<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterlyearnings results conference call.</p>
<p>Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn 
thecall over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and 
ChiefFinancial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, CINTAS CORPORATION:</b>
 Thankyou, and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice 
Presidentand Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for 
fiscal2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any 
questions.</p>
<p>The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a 
safeharbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. 
Thisconference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect 
thecompany's current views as to future events and financialperformance.
 These forward-looking statements are subject to risksand uncertainties,
 which could cause actual results to differmaterially from those we may 
discuss. I refer you to the discussionon these points contained in our 
most recent filings with the SEC.</p>
<p>Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, 
was$1,718,000,000, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter.The
 organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts 
ofacquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, wasalso 
7%.</p>
<p>The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and 
FacilityServices segment was 6.6%. And the organic growth rate of the 
FirstAid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the G&amp;K Services acquisition nearly 
2years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the 
acquiredrevenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services 
growthrates. We've discussed that the organic revenue growth rate 
wouldreach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year due to 
thelapping of the G&amp;K acquisition and that we expected the 
organicgrowth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal '19.</p>
<p>Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded 
asexpected from the first quarter's rate of 4.9%. In fact, this 
organicgrowth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have 
seenour sales rep productivity reach preacquisition levels, and 
we'veseen good performance in penetrating legacy G&amp;K 
customers,particularly in the hygiene space.</p>
<p>Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $775 
millionincreased 8.2% from last year's second quarter. Gross margin as 
apercentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 
'19compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. 
UniformRental and Facility Services gross margin as a percentage of 
revenueimproved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last 
fiscalyear.</p>
<p>Gross margin improved in the quarter and year to date, despite 
somecost headwinds we cited on last quarter's earnings call, 
includingwage inflation and higher cost for certain commodities.</p>
<p>Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 
millioncompared to $235 million in last year's second quarter. 
Operatingincome was negatively impacted by integration expenses related 
to theG&amp;K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of 
fiscal'19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '18. 
Excludingintegration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 
14.2%,resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% 
lastyear.</p>
<p>Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter offiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction.</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter offiscal
 '19 of $243 million increased 76% from last year's secondquarter net 
income from continuing operations of $138 million.Diluted EPS from 
continuing operations for the second quarter offiscal '19 were $2.18, an
 increase of about 76% from the EPS fromcontinuing operations for the 
second quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.24.Net income and EPS from continuing
 operations were positivelyimpacted by a lower effective tax rate in 
this fiscal year's secondquarter compared to last year's second quarter,
 primarily from theenactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.</p>
<p>Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second 
quarterof fiscal '19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a 
costmethod investment. Also, net income and EPS from 
continuingoperations were negatively impacted in second quarter of 
fiscal '19and '18 by $0.05 and $0.07, respectively from integration 
expensesrelated to the G&amp;K acquisition.</p>
<p>Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from 
continuingoperations were $1.76 compared to last year's EPS from 
continuingoperations of $1.31. We provided these figures in a table in 
today'spress release.</p>
<p>As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for 
theremainder of the fiscal year, we're increasing our annual guidance.We
 are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to$6.855 
billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPSfrom 
continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a newrange of 
$7.30 to $7.38.</p>
<p>Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes 
anadditional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from 
lastquarter's guidance due to having some commercial paper. It 
stillassumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the 
samerate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share 
countfor computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume 
anyadditional G&amp;K integration expenses. However, we do expect 
toincur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the 
fullfiscal year.</p>
<p>As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted 
intoday's press release, we are pleased with our progress on 
theintegration of the G&amp;K acquisition and the implementation of 
ourenterprise resource planning system. We are on track to 
achieveanother year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And 
additionally,we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to 
effectivelydeploying cash to increase shareholder value.</p>
<p>As a reminder, on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 
pershare, an increase of 26.5% over last year's annual dividend. 
Andthrough the end of our second quarter, we purchased $447 million 
ofCintas stock under our buyback authorizations.</p>
<p>I'll now turn the call over to Paul.</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER, VP &amp; TREASURER, CINTAS CORPORATION:</b> Thank 
you,Mike. Please note that our fiscal second quarter contained the 
samenumber of workdays as the prior year second quarter. 
Additionally,there will be no workday differences the remainder of the 
fiscalyear, as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number 
ofworkdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18.</p>
<p>We have 2 reportable operating segments, uniform Rental and 
FacilityServices and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of 
ourbusiness is included in All Other.</p>
<p>All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform 
DirectSales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other 
arecombined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.</p>
<p>Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes 
therental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provisionof
 restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Thesegment 
also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to ourcustomers en 
route.</p>
<p>Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,390,000,000, 
anincrease of 6.3% compared to last year's second quarter. Excludingthe 
impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange ratechanges, the 
organic growth rate was 6.6%.</p>
<p>Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin 
was45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year's 
secondquarter, an improvement of 60 basis points.</p>
<p>Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4%, equal to 
lastyear's second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin 
expansionthis quarter and year to date and our ability to overcome 
wageinflation; increased commodity costs, such as for hangers, which 
aresourced mostly from China; and the inefficiencies that are 
customarywith an acquisition integration and an ERP system 
implementation.</p>
<p>Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes 
revenuefrom the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety 
productsand training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was 
$153million, which was 10.3% higher than last year's second quarter.</p>
<p>On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. 
Thissegment's gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared 
to46.9% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.</p>
<p>Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited 
bypenetration of existing customers and national account new 
business.Solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are 
confirmation ofthe value that businesses in all sectors of the economy 
place onoutsourcing to Cintas the management of their first aid, safety 
andtraining programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe 
andproductive.</p>
<p>Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses 
arereported in the All Other category. Our fire business continues 
togrow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale 
businessgrowth rates are generally low single digits and are subject 
tovolatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account.</p>
<p>Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and 
itscustomers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell 
andprovide products and services from our other business units.</p>
<p>All Other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared 
tolast year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and 
wasdriven by 14% organic growth in the fire business.</p>
<p>All Other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of thisfiscal
 year compared to 42.1% for last year's second quarter.Improvement in 
the fire business gross margin year-over-year was morethan offset by 
lower gross margins and Uniform Direct Sale business.</p>
<p>Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
were28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year's 
secondquarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '19, there was a benefit 
of$6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from theadoption 
of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue fromcontracts with 
customers. We discussed this on our July earnings callwhen we provided 
our initial fiscal '19 guidance. In addition to thisbenefit, we are 
getting good leverage from increased revenue coveringfixed costs.</p>
<p>Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the secondquarter
 benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidancefor fiscal
 '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that theeffective tax 
rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based ontax reserve builds 
and releases relating to discrete items, includingthe amount of stock 
compensation benefits in each period.</p>
<p>Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 
million.Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. 
OurCapEx by operating segment was as follows, $58 million in 
UniformRental and Facility Services, $10 million in First Aid and Safety
 and$5 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in 
therange of $270 million to $285 million.</p>
<p>As of November 30, total debt was $2,710,000,000. $2,536,000,000 
isfixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable ratescommercial 
paper. At November 30, our leverage was 2.1xdebt-to-EBITDA.</p>
<p>That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer yourquestions.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from ManavPatnaik with Barclays.</p>
<p><b>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK, DIRECTOR &amp; LEAD RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYSBANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 First broader question, obviously, is --just curious, obviously, you've
 seen the market reacting in a fearfulmanner. Just curious, from what 
you're hearing from your customers,any signs of things slowing down or 
any signs of worry based on whatyou are hearing and seeing there?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> No, Manav. We -- I think from -- based on 
ourresults, which we believe are pretty good, we've seen a pretty 
goodeconomic environment for the last quarter and we're not hearing 
signsof slowdown right now. And I would suggest that our guidance 
ispretty strong as well and reflects confidence that we're going 
tofinish the year pretty strong, so no.</p>
<p><b>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK:</b> Okay. And then on the G&amp;K side, you 
talkedabout making some progress, I guess, on the revenue synergy 
side,especially in the hygiene area. I was just hoping you could 
helpmaybe quantify or give some color there and how we should think 
aboutwhat the future opportunities there are.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, we haven't quantified that 
specificallyother than to say certainly that Cintas percentage of 
hygiene revenueis greater than G&amp;K's was prior to us acquiring them.
 We'remaking some nice progress on that. I don't have a specific number 
toshare with you, because many of the accounts are kind of blended in.</p>
<p>But we certainly know that we're getting some traction there. And 
welike that restroom product opportunity. We like substituting 
ourentrance mats for theirs. We think there is still an opportunity 
inthe future for Carhartt garments and other things. But making 
someprogress so far, and we like what we've seen.</p>
<p><b>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK:</b> All right. Got it. And then just last 
question.Just moving pieces on the energy side with, obviously, the oil 
pricesdown. Any color on how we should think of that or if you 
factoredthat -- some of that in your increased guidance today?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> We've assumed that we may still have just a
 slighttouch of pressure for the rest of the year, even though we 
didn'thave any in the second quarter. It's hard to predict what 
that'sgoing to look like for the second half. But right now, we 
haven'treally changed our outlook, and that was to be up slightly in 
thesecond half of the year.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And next will be Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p><b>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN, SENIOR ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 Just looking at the guidance, this quarter, you bought backjust under 
$370 million of stock. And in the back half of the year,that should be a
 pretty nice help to you, just given the lower sharecount from that. I'm
 calculating somewhere around, call it, $0.08.You beat consensus this 
quarter. I know that's not necessarily yourinternal target. But let's 
just say you beat by at least a couple ofcents there.</p>
<p>And then obviously, you mentioned the higher interest, so maybe 
$0.02from that as an offset. But basically, a $0.10 guidance raise sort 
ofimplies to me that either maybe there is some conservativism there 
orjust trying to get a sense of -- I know you just mentioned thatyou're 
expecting a good back half of the year. But like basically,why not raise
 by more? Sorry for the long-winded question.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> No problem. Toni, the low end of our 
guidance nowis higher than the high end of our guidance last quarter. 
You'reright on it in terms of the second half of the year buyback 
impact.But Toni, the second half of the year, last year, we did 
operatingmargins of 16.3%. The guidance that we've provided would 
suggest thehigh -- mid to high 16%.</p>
<p>So there's still going to be some nice margin improvement in 
thesecond half of the year. The revenue is looking very good. That was 
apretty good increase as well where the low end of the range is 
higherthan our previous -- I'm sorry, the low end of the range is 
higherthan our previous high end of the range.</p>
<p>We think it's a pretty nice second half of the year. And if we 
canachieve that guidance, that's a pretty darn good year with 
marginexpansion, continued G&amp;K integration, SAP integration 
andincreasing organic growth.</p>
<p><b>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN:</b> Okay, great. And then just one more on 
buybacks.Just given you have $744 million authorization remaining in 
yourprogram, just given where the stock has been trading recently and 
youjust did a lot of buybacks in this past quarter, like how should webe
 thinking about sort of your views on timing of repurchases or your-- 
going forward?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, our remaining authorization is a 
little bitover $800 million, it's about $860 million. We did run out 
ofprevious authorization during the quarter. We expect it to continueto 
have pretty good cash flow. We obviously think that the stockprice today
 is an opportunity.</p>
<p>But we also like our leverage level. We're at 2.1x. That's right 
atour target. And I would suggest that we're going to continue to 
beright around that level unless we see something different 
change,something new come about. We certainly have seen it to be a 
buyingopportunity, though, and think that there's been certainly 
anoverreaction to our stock in the last 90 days.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bankof America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><b>GARY ELIZABETH BISBEE, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 I guess, the first question, just last quarter, you talkedabout the 
second half of the year getting back to 5.5%, 6% organicrevenue in 
rentals. Obviously, you blew right through that, andyou're taking the 
guidance up. But as we look at it, it appears likethe comps get easier 
on a year-over-year basis. Is there anythingthat would lead to any 
deceleration from that? Or was there anythingthat was a benefit this 
quarter? Just trying to think if this is agood run rate in the near 
term.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, when we think about this quarter, we 
thinkabout the impact of better sales rep productivity than we 
initiallyexpected. So I don't see that changing much. We also talked 
about thepenetration opportunities with all of our customers remains 
prettystrong. So that guidance range that we gave is something in the 
wayof 6% to the low 7%, and we think that's a pretty good range for usto
 be in. That's right in our sweet spot.</p>
<p><b>GARY ELIZABETH BISBEE:</b> You -- on the last couple of calls, 
you'vementioned the National Accounts opportunity of First Aid and 
Safety.Is that -- I don't remember hearing you mention that a lot over 
thelast few years. Is that a newer opportunity or just something 
thatyou're calling out now? And I guess, I've always thought that is 
much-- mostly a local business. What are you doing on the 
NationalAccounts front?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> It's not necessarily a new opportunity. It 
is onethat we have started to talk about and we love the opportunity. 
Andit is same as you might think in rental where we have the ability 
toprovide large multi-location customers with a consistent safety 
--First Aid and Safety program, and that's important to these 
largecustomers. It allows them to track their locations a little 
bitbetter, to understand their compliance on a more consistent basis.</p>
<p>And so we've got an offering that not many others can provide, 
andthat has become a real nice growth opportunity for us in the 
businessand one that we've started to call out a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>GARY ELIZABETH BISBEE:</b> Great. And then just on the tax rate, 
can youhelp us flesh out what's sort of the statutory rate or the 
normalizedrate post tax reform now that we're almost a year into that? 
And howmuch is the tax rate benefiting from that equity comp 
accountingchange of 1.5 years ago or so? And I guess, I'm just trying to
 thinkover the next few years, what could the tax rate go up to if 
thataccounting change benefit around equity comp were to flatten out?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Yes, it's a real good question, Gary. We 
certainly-- with the new accounting guidance, we're going to see a 
little bitmore fluctuation in our tax rate. I -- we expect it to be in a
 24-ishtype of a percent range, and again, that can move.</p>
<p>Now not all of that difference from 24% to 21.7% is the equity 
comp,but it certainly is a good chunk of that. If that turns around, 
wecould see it get closer to 24% and in some cases may even get 
higherthan 24%. But that's kind of where we see a steady range. And 
whatyou saw in the second quarter of 24.2% roughly is a quarter without 
abig stock compensation benefit, like you saw in the first quarter.</p>
<p><b>GARY ELIZABETH BISBEE:</b> Great. And then if I could just sneak 
oneother. Is there any update on that accounting change benefit for 
thisyear? I think you said 16% to 19%, the higher end of 16% to 19%. 
Isthat still a good run rate?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> The benefit -- I think Paul called that out. Itwas $6.1 million in the quarter.</p>
<p><b>GARY ELIZABETH BISBEE:</b> For the year?</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER:</b> Yes, that range...</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> I think given that it's been, what, 11% in 
thefirst half of the year, it's probably going to be closer to that 
typeof 20% to 22% type of range.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And moving on, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazariwith Macquarie.</p>
<p><b>HAMZAH MAZARI, SENIOR ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH:</b> My first 
questionis just on cross-selling as well. Maybe if you could just frame 
forus how many customers are buying multiple services from you 
todayversus sort of historically. And where does that number go to or 
whatcan it go to? Any thoughts on penetration there?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Yes, we don't have those numbers to share 
withyou, Hamzah. But we think there certainly is a big opportunity 
there.As we've talked in the past. the biggest penetration is with 
ouruniform rental and entrance mat products. But all of our 
otherproducts would then be under 20% penetrated. And we certainly 
thinkthat we can get above 20% with many of those. So we still have a 
lotof run rate, and we -- that certainly has been beneficial to 
thegrowth over the last few years.</p>
<p><b>HAMZAH MAZARI:</b> Got it. And then just on first aid, one of 
yourcompetitors said recently they're going to get into that market. 
Justmaybe frame for us how sustainable is that 10% organic growth 
numberand sort of the competitive dynamic you see in first aid today, 
justsort of update us there.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Sure. We -- when we think about that 
business, welike the high singles and low doubles -- digits in terms of 
organicgrowth run rate. And do we think it's sustainable? We do, 
certainlyin the next -- for the next several years, absent a big change 
in themacro environment.</p>
<p>In this business, the biggest competition is what we might call inthe
 rental business the no programmer or the customer that's doing 
itthemselves. There are still many of them out there, and we 
believewe've got a great value to provide to them.</p>
<p>So we do think there are many opportunities out there for ourservice,
 and we think there is a great value in our ability todeliver that 
compared to the do it yourself-ers and the catalogpurchasers and that 
kind of thing. So we like the -- we love thebusiness, we like the 
organic growth rate. We think that cancontinue.</p>
<p><b>HAMZAH MAZARI:</b> Great. And then just last question. You talked 
aboutbuybacks. Your debt is pretty low on leverage sort of 2.1. How 
areyou guys thinking about M&amp;A? Do you have too much on your 
platewith the synergies and ERP? Or are you sort of ready to look 
atM&amp;A maybe in a different vertical. Any thoughts on M&amp;A?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> We are looking at M&amp;A. We are ready. 
And if --the thing about M&amp;A is we can't always predict when 
thoseopportunities come along. And so we want to make sure that we 
areready. And we're looking at -- we're looking in our -- certainly 
inour rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business, in ourfire 
business. If we can find tuck-ins or even larger than 
tuck-inopportunities, we will certainly take a look at them. We 
thinkthere's a lot of long-term value in that kind of investment.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 When you mentioned what was driving the strength in rentalorganic 
revenue growth, you mentioned penetration of existingaccounts and some 
National Account wins. I was wondering if you'djust give us 
directionally the other typical drivers of revenuegrowth. How was 
retention year-over-year? Is net realized pricingaccelerating at all? 
And of course, just a quick comment onadd-stops.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> It was led by our new business, as it 
usually is,but we've seen some real nice productivity out of our sales 
team.That sales team -- also as we've talked about over the last 
severalyears, that sales team also sells into existing customers, and 
that'sbeen going very well also. And so that has helped the historical 
netadd-stop metric that we talk about in our industry. It certainly 
hasbeen positive from the standpoint of getting some benefit from 
oursales team.</p>
<p>Retention is right where we want it to be and it's as good as 
it'sbeen. It's in the mid-90% range and has not changed a bunch over 
thelast couple of quarters. And pricing -- remains a favorable 
pricingenvironment. I wouldn't say it's changed much in the last 
severalquarters, but still a pretty good environment nonetheless.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN:</b> Okay. And just as a quick 
follow-up. Justclarify what you meant before when sales productivity is 
back topremerger levels. Did you mean that both the Cintas legacy 
salesforce and now your inherited G&amp;K sales force were back to 
Cintaslevels of sales productivity? I didn't quite understand if you 
meantboth.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, let's be clear, it's one sales team now.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN:</b> It is.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> And so we measure it all together and it is
 highercombined than it was preacquisition. So in other words, our 
newpartners and recently hired partners from that deal, they have 
madesome real nice progress and are certainly being productive in a 
waythat we want them to be productive.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And the next question will come from George Tong withGoldman Sachs.</p>
<p><b>GEORGE TONG, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 You've indicated that you're assuming a touch of pressurefor the rest 
of the year from energy. Can you elaborate on whetheryou're internally 
planning for oil prices to stay at current levelsas you think about the 
demand impact and how you expect gross marginsto be impacted by energy?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, let's talk about the pressures -- the
 costpressures that we've cited. From an energy perspective, it was 
flatin the quarter year-over-year and we're expecting it to be just 
upslightly. We don't get specific enough to provide you an oil price.But
 we think it'll be up slightly for the back half of the year.</p>
<p>We have talked a little bit about the labor. We're seeing that 
inpockets, as we've said over the last several quarters, and 
thatcertainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and 
itis contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. Sothe
 great news is we've been able to increase gross margins in thisquarter 
and for the year and expect that to continue despite somepressure from 
labor.</p>
<p>We also talked a little bit about some commodities. You can kind 
ofthink of this as the trade impact, right? And last -- if you 
thinkabout China, for example, we've seen a bucket announced in July 
oftariff increases on a certain set of products and services. We werenot
 impacted by that. A second bucket team in September, we wereslightly 
impacted by that, and we touched on that last quarter.Again, it's a 
pretty small amount, but that may continue.</p>
<p>And certainly then, it's too early to tell on anything else that 
maychange with China. We also -- we didn't touch on it last time, 
butcertainly, NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we 
cancontinue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, 
butif we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the U.S. MCA, notmuch
 of a change there either. So the really good news is, while wedo see a 
little bit of an impact, it hasn't been significant and itis certainly 
within our guided numbers.</p>
<p>And really while we're on trade, if we think about our supply 
chain,we've got a really good global supply chain. And we've talked 
abouthow we control much of what we purchase. And when I say control, 
weeither have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we alsocontrol
 then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabricsaround the world
 to different sewing suppliers.</p>
<p>We have the ability to be flexible with that. And as trade and -- 
astrade changes, we have the ability to be flexible where many of 
ourcompetitors do not. They are either tied to their own manufacturingor
 tied to third-party suppliers. We have the flexibility to be muchmore 
flexible than that.</p>
<p>And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we likethe
 way we are able to perform. We like the way we are able toleverage our 
infrastructure to find efficiencies. And that's whatyou're seeing in 
this guidance and in our current results. We're ableto increase our 
gross and operating margins despite some of thesepressures.</p>
<p>Now that could change if the macro environment or trade 
significantlychanges, and we'll certainly let you know about that. But 
as we standtoday, we like the way we're able to adapt to some changes in
 theenvironment and still improve margins.</p>
<p><b>GEORGE TONG:</b> Got it. That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, 
can youtalk about what you're seeing in the manufacturing verticals and 
inthe oil and gas verticals, given the recent movement in oil prices,if 
the pipeline looking out over the next several quarters haschanged at 
all, especially when you compare it to earlier oil cycleswith -- that 
have experienced similar levels of decline?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Yes, I can't say that we've seen much of a 
changeat this point in time. It may be a little early. But we've seen 
atleast our business be pretty healthy in those and many otherverticals.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And next will be Andy Wittmann with Baird.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp;CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I just thought I would ask,maybe I missed it in the script. But could 
you talk about the SAPimplementation, Mike, and talk about maybe an 
update on where you arein terms of the number of locations or maybe the 
percentage ofrevenue that is now operating under that system and kind of
 what youroutlook is here on the implementation in terms of timing of 
theendpoint of that has moved at all?</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER:</b> Andy, it's Paul. We did not comment on SAP 
inparticular in the script, but we are still making nice progress. 
Ithink last quarter, we mentioned -- and I can't remember the numberof 
locations, but we said that we had implemented about 42% of them,and 
we're now at about 48%. So just about halfway through.</p>
<p>So again, like we've talked about previously, things are going 
verywell because of the nature of the implementation and how our 
existingoperating IT system is with a series of new AS400s boxes all 
over it.It takes time to go from one to the other to the other. 
Buteverything is going well, and we're still on track to complete 
theimplementation in fiscal '20.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Great. And maybe just kind of a 
similarquestion, given that a lot of this is concurrent. But just on 
theG&amp;K integration, this was the year with a lot of the 
rerouting,which is obviously a very tricky thing or can be. Can you talk
 aboutwhere you are on that key thing, process in terms of how much 
hasbeen rerouted and how that's going?</p>
<p>And then maybe just more broadly on G&amp;K overall, as you get 
moreintertwined here, how are you feeling about that synergy number 
andwhat was recognized in the run rate maybe that -- of synergies 
thatyou were -- recognized in the quarter in the run rate that you're 
ontoday?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Sure. The route optimization continues. But
 as wetalked about, we remain cautious in doing that, because that 
reallytouches the customers. It's movement of volume, it's affecting 
SSRrelationships. And so we're being very cautious. I don't have 
apercentage or a dollar revenue number to share, Andy. But we 
arecontinuing to move forward with that, and it's going well. And Ithink
 the cautious approach is certainly helping us.</p>
<p>From an overall G&amp;K standpoint, as you mentioned, it continues 
toget more and more intertwined. And part of the rerouting and theroute 
optimization is even more intertwining. So I think I've talkeda little 
bit about this where if we have multiple locations, legacyCintas and 
legacy G&amp;K, part of that route optimization results involume 
possibly moving from one plant to another.</p>
<p>So even a legacy G&amp;K facility today that has participated inroute
 optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there. So itgets 
more and more intertwined. However, we certainly like theperformance 
that we've seen out of the business, out of theintegration activities, 
and we still feel very good about the synergynumbers that we've put out 
there.</p>
<p>We estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million insynergies
 that continues us very well on to our expectation for thisfiscal '19 
year. And we still feel very good about hitting ourtargets for the full 
-- for the -- over time for the entireacquisition.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger withOppenheimer.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT ANDREW SCHNEEBERGER, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp;CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 It's actually 3. Want to slip one herein front. In Uniform Rental and 
Facility Services, I'm just -- I'mcurious, you may have said it, I might
 have missed it. The fiscalsecond half organic growth, because the 6.6% 
was loftier than you hadexpected, I'm just curious what is the 
expectation in the secondhalf? Are we talking high 6s or better or 
should we temper, becauseyou said kind of -- I'm just kind of curious if
 there are any moreclarification and if I missed it.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Yes, we don't give guidance by segment, 
Scott. Butthe guidance range that we do have for the total company is 
about 6%to 7.2% I think?</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> And that would certainly suggest that there isroom for continued acceleration in that range.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT ANDREW SCHNEEBERGER:</b> Appreciate it. That's helpful. So 
yes,visibility is my question. It's been asked a lot. Obviously, you 
guys-- and you mentioned some new business wins lately that 
maybetrickles into the back half. Sounds like you're very confident 
forthe back half.</p>
<p>I'm curious if you could talk maybe to some of your end markets, 
whatthe visibility would be out? You don't have to speak to your 
currentbusiness conditions. But what visibility is typically -- can you 
seeout more than 6 months? And if so, how far?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, we try to see out as far as we can, 
andthat's -- we -- from an external point of view, we generally keep 
ourguidance to the current fiscal year. Internally, we are 
certainlylooking ahead in how we expect to perform in fiscal '20 and '21
 andgoing forward.</p>
<p>I would say this, Scott, absent a significant change in the macro, 
welike the way we are performing right now. We -- our sales force 
isperforming very well. Our integration continues, and we -- as we 
getmore and more of that behind us, we can get more and more efficientin
 the way we operate.</p>
<p>We like our products and services. We think it's a broad 
opportunity.We are not -- certainly not fully penetrated. And so we 
continue tolike the opportunity to sell to existing customers.</p>
<p>So we feel like the business is running very well. And I don't see 
achange in our ability to execute unless something happens in themacro 
that throws a wrench in the works. But what we all here atCintas look 
forward to is getting more and more of the integrationand the SAP 
implementation behind us so that we can even become alittle bit more 
efficient in the way we operate.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT ANDREW SCHNEEBERGER:</b> Great, good answer. And then 
lastly, theCapEx guidance went down this quarter from last quarter, 
which wentdown from the prior quarter. Not huge, but it's trickling 
down. I'mjust curious, is that maybe SAP related or is it something 
else? Justkind of curious on that development.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> It's purely timing, Scott. We are 
continuingcertainly to invest where we need to. Some of it is timing 
from thestandpoint of when we may need to bring a new plant online. That
 canmove a little bit here and there depending on the situations in 
thoselocal markets. So more than anything, it's just timing.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And the next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum withStifel.</p>
<p><b>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY,INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 Paul, just wanted to ask a littlebit on the free cash flow. It's down 
first half like $40 million. ARDSO is up 3 days sequentially. Is there a
 build in anticipation offuture sales or something? Is there a timing 
thing? Or just kind of abuild-up as you're expecting continued sales 
execution? Can you giveus some clarity on that?</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER:</b> Yes. I mean, as you can see, it's in working 
capitaland there's really 2 -- I guess, 2 larger categories that are 
drivingit, and both are temporary. So we don't think there's 
anythingstructural here that we're concerned with. The one is 
accountsreceivable, I mean, you can certainly see that on the balance 
sheetand on the cash flow statements. And we don't have concerns 
aboutcollectability. Our customers really need and want what we 
provide,and they do pay.</p>
<p>But Mike has talked many times on prior calls about theinefficiencies
 that exist within the organization when you have 2significant projects 
going on at the same time, the G&amp;Kintegration, the SAP 
implementation. We have a lot of systemconversions, customers are 
impacted, billing changes, invoices looksdifferent. And because of that 
disruption, it is causing someslowdown in cash coming in, a little bit 
of a build of AR. But again,we believe it's nothing but temporary, and 
we will collect.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> And let's not forget, we've got some really
 nicegrowth, and that certainly increases the AR. And there was about a 
--close to a $20 million impact from the rev rec adoption.</p>
<p><b>PAUL F. ADLER:</b> Yes. And to build on Mike's comment about the 
growth,the other bucket is inventory. And we talked last quarter about 
thefact that to support our growth, we have a new distribution center, 
afacility services distribution center that came online. We werebuilding
 inventory to ramp that up and get ready to put thatoperation in place. 
So we're still burning off that inventory. It's alittle bit elevated at 
this point in time.</p>
<p>And then finally, Shlomo, we have a little bit of inventory 
build,because what we're finding is we've had SKUs historically with 
justCintas standalone that were not sufficient enough in the demand 
forus to inventory them and stock them in our distribution centers. 
Sowhat would happen is our operations would just order these items 
fromvarious vendors directly, and they would ship back to 
thoseoperations.</p>
<p>But now with the increased volume from G&amp;K, it does make sense 
toput more SKUs into the distribution center, manage it 
centrally,negotiate better cost by doing that. And so that is a little 
bit ofan inventory build. But ultimately, again that's a timing thing 
andthat's a measure we're putting in place, because we believe that 
willhelp us manage costs and lower them in the...</p>
<p><b>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM:</b> Okay, great. And then just -- it's been 
close toa year since Aramark or AmeriPride. And I was just wondering 
ifyou're seeing any change in terms of their competitiveness. 
They'rekind of a year into their integration. It was mentioned that 
they'replanning to get into first aid and hygiene. I was just 
wondering,from your guys on the ground, the ones that are actually 
talking tocustomers and noticing who else is driving around, are you 
seeing anychanges from them that you're kind of monitoring?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, we always like to monitor what 
ourcompetitors are doing and that's not just Aramark and AmeriPride, 
butall of our competitors. I would say nothing significant that we 
wouldcall out at this point.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And moving on to John Healy with Northcoast Research.</p>
<p><b>JOHN MICHAEL HEALY, MD &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, NORTHCOASTRESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC:</b>
 Mike, I wanted to ask a question just tryingto look at legacy Cintas 
customers and what are Cintas customers now,but acquired through 
G&amp;K. If you looked at the revenue per stopor the revenue per wearer,
 however you'd kind of maybe boil thatmetric down, what would you say is
 the difference between the Cintaslegacy customer and what you acquired 
from G&amp;K? And if you lookedout over the next year or 2, how much of 
that gap do you think youstill have the potential to close?</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, we -- our revenue per stop certainly 
wasgreater than G&amp;K's was prior to the acquisition. And we 
thinkthere certainly remains that opportunity. We are -- I would say 
we'reclosing the gap, but that's going to be a very -- it's a slow 
creep,I guess, and it'll take some time.</p>
<p>And one thing to keep in mind is we're still adding many newcustomers
 every year. And those customers, we want to continue -- wehave the 
opportunity to continue to penetrate as well.</p>
<p>So I don't have a very specific metric that I'm -- that I can 
share.But certainly, our revenue per stop was greater, and there still 
ismore opportunity, both in our existing -- our legacy customers andthe 
legacy G&amp;K customers. We like that penetration opportunity.</p>
<p><b>JOHN MICHAEL HEALY:</b> Okay, fair enough. And then I wanted to 
ask ---with the movement in oil, and doesn't sound you guys have seen 
greatchange in the business. Was there much difference between how 
theU.S. and the Canadian operations performed in the quarter? Just 
kindof curious if you're seeing much deviation there.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> No. I mean, there's a lot going on in 
bothcountries in terms of implementations and integrations. And I 
wouldsay, no, nothing to call out.</p>
<p><b>JOHN MICHAEL HEALY:</b> Okay, great. And then just kind of one 
bigpicture question for you, Mike. I feel like every business 
leader,their comments are extremely scrutinized right now in terms of 
howthey feel about the economy and pace of investments and things 
alongthose lines. When I hear your call and look at your numbers, 
therereally isn't much to be negative about, I mean, quite strong 
acrossthe board and you guys are buying a ton of stock back.</p>
<p>Beneath the surface, though, are you doing anything different versus3
 months ago than you thought you would be in terms of hiring 
people,making any sort of internal investment, whether it's in 
thetechnology or logistics or operations? I'm just curious from a 
CFO'sperspective, are you doing anything different versus what you 
thoughtmaybe 3 months ago.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> The only thing we're doing is the revenue 
and thegrowth has been better than we thought 90 days ago. Certainly, 
youcan tell from our guidance raise. And we continue to invest for 
thefuture.</p>
<p>We like the way that the economy is operating right now. It 
createsand provides a lot of opportunity for our products and services 
andall of our businesses, and we are continuing to move forward. We 
--the last thing we want to do is start pulling back on our growthlevers
 simply to try to predict a change in the economy. We'recontinuing to 
invest and grow, like we set out to do at the beginningof this fiscal 
year.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And the next question will come from Tim Mulrooney withWilliam Blair.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY MICHAEL MULROONEY, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANYL.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 So now that you've basically got half yourbranches converted to the new
 SAP system, do you have any earlytakeaways you can share with us with 
respect to the new system? Haveyou been positively surprised by 
anything, finding new opportunities?And how are these branches 
responding to change management, which Iknow can be difficult sometimes?
 Any extra color here would be great.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Yes. I think the farther we get into 
theintegration -- or the implementation of SAP, I would say the easierit
 gets, because we are getting better and better at it. As Paulsaid, 
we've got a lot of locations in a lot of different markets, andwe learn 
from every one, and each one becomes a little bit moreefficient.</p>
<p>So it certainly is still a big change management project. And like 
Isaid, we're learning with each market that converts. And that meanswe 
are getting ahead of the conversion. We do a lot of communication.We do a
 lot of training. We do a lot of not just training in terms oflooking at
 documents and understanding, but actually doing andworking in the 
system.</p>
<p>So we've gotten, we believe, to be pretty efficient and pretty goodat
 getting our locations prepared. Having said that, certainly isstill a 
disruption and it takes time to get through. It takes time toget our 
customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice, etcetera. So 
disruption will continue until we're finished with it, butwe get better 
and better with each one.</p>
<p>From a standpoint of what have we seen out of the system, we reallydo
 like the efficiency that it brings to our SSRs. Our SSRs are 
ourdrivers. They have handheld computers. They are much better and 
muchmore efficient than they used to be. And so we like how those 
areworking.</p>
<p>Our First Aid and Safety business has been on SAP for a few years,and
 we like the knowledge and the information it gives to thatbusiness. 
We're starting to see a little bit of that in the rentalbusiness. And as
 you can tell from the First Aid and Safety business,we like how our 
growth is going there. So we -- I wouldn't say thatwe have seen a lot 
surprises from the standpoint of things that wedidn't expect, but we 
like what we see.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And that does conclude the question-and-answer 
session.I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional
 orclosing remarks.</p>
<p><b>J. MICHAEL HANSEN:</b> Well, thank you again for joining us 
tonight. Wewill issue our third quarter financial results in mid to late
 March,and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. 
Andhappy holidays to all.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Wedo thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE Inc.'s Fiscal 
2019 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference 
today's press release, you will find it at http://investors.nike.com. 
Leading today's call is Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor 
Relations and Treasurer.</p>
<p> Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that 
participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on 
current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks 
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the
 SEC, including the annual report filed on Form 10-K. Some 
forward-looking statements may concern expectations of future revenue 
growth or gross margin.</p>
<p> In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, 
including references to constant dollar revenue. References to constant 
dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of 
the business, eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants 
may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical 
information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent nonpublic 
financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of 
comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be made 
available at NIKE's website, http://investors.nike.com.</p>
<p> Now I'd like to turn the call over to Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.</p>
<p> NITESH SHARAN, VP OF IR &amp; TREASURER, NIKE, INC.: Thank you, 
operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss
 NIKE Inc.'s fiscal 2019 second quarter results. As the operator 
indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial 
measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press 
release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, 
investors.nike.com.</p>
<p> Joining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc. Chairman, President and
 CEO, Mark Parker; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. 
Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. (Operator
 Instructions) Thanks for your cooperation on this.</p>
<p> I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NIKE, INC.: Thanks, 
Nitesh. Hello and happy holidays, everyone. We've seen some amazing 
highlights in sports this past year. Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon
 World Record. Simone Biles dominated the world championships. Kylian 
Mbappé became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued 
to inspire on and off the court.</p>
<p> It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was
 another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress
 against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct 
connections and speed and agility around the world.</p>
<p> Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, 
profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while 
aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We 
set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more.</p>
<p> The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer 
expectations are accelerating and the macro-economy is increasingly 
volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to 
double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold 
through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For 
example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're 
creating sports first smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a 
global supply chain that delivers personal at scale. It's all incredibly
 energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we 
grow.</p>
<p> Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building 
new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of 
industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding 
excellent results.</p>
<p> For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral 
basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis 
points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year.</p>
<p> Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 
20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital 
growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in 
both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth
 in the Jordan business.</p>
<p> The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation.
 We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline
 to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road
 map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to 
shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and 
choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the
 return on investment in innovation.</p>
<p> One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being
 energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max [270], 2 of the 
world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our
 icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to 
add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The 
consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest 
high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle.</p>
<p> NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform 
beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 
55; and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale 
significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids that
 combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic 
React 2.0 coming in spring.</p>
<p> As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening 
them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned 
on our call -- last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately 
priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete 
consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle
 icons and core-only innovations.</p>
<p> At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no 
innovation delivers on that promise like ZoomX and the VaporFly 4%, 
which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started 
something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the 
world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to 
come here.</p>
<p> That reputation has made its way to everyday athletes, making 4%, 
the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect 
for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, 
driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2.</p>
<p> I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new 
adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We 
have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in 
advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is 
just one better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we 
look forward to rolling them out throughout the year.</p>
<p> We have a full innovation pipeline ahead including new cushioning 
platforms which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, 
all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with 
the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've 
ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel.
 We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability 
is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates 
change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed 
leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE 
Flyknit represents a multibillion dollar business and uses 60% less 
waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled 
manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're 
making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, 
driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business.</p>
<p> Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic 
impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than 
innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as 
how to account for different environments through moisture management, 
creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping a garment 
comfortable when it's twisting and turning. Through new materials and 
methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in 
performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style.</p>
<p> Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example,
 in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. 
Our NBA apparel accelerated in year 2, especially with our city editions
 jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one's 
surprise, LeBron's moved to the Lakers has also created opportunity. We 
already booked 3x more NIKE Lakers gear this year. And our work with the
 NBA has also created a lift for NIKE inline basketball apparel. We 
built on the success of our Showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants,
 which have seen great sell-through.</p>
<p> Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and
 internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category
 this quarter.</p>
<p> In Sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this 
quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In
 Sportswear, we're anchoring our communications around head-to-toe 
collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop the complete 
look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling.</p>
<p> Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities.
 And in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited 
about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World 
Cup in France. A yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for 
the first time at NIKE. New tights innovation, and expanded NIKE Tech 
Pack collection.</p>
<p> 2 other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know 
we have much more opportunity ahead, is Women's and Jordan. There's 
incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes, elite and 
everyday, lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong
 appetite for athletic footwear and apparel.</p>
<p> This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, 
footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and Sneakers For 
Her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as her 
favorite franchise, owning the #1 spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running.</p>
<p> Our Edit to Amplify strategy to offer more color and material 
choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top 3 
selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 
270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains
 a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2.</p>
<p> Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the 
pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, 
including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, 
we'll continue to -- our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and 
everyday female athletes around the world.</p>
<p> We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport
 with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from
 the strategic shifts that we're making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digit
 and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the
 same time, we've continued our pace of double-digit growth 
internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. 
Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. 
Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations 
and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January.</p>
<p> Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, 
led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing
 well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, 
we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which
 is more coveted than ever.</p>
<p> At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the 
most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI 
Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting 
that offered preheat Paris to our members, total integration across our 
business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally 
driven storytelling in our key cities.</p>
<p> The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to 
drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. 
We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity
 ahead.</p>
<p> In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we 
scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the 
momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw it over the 
Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our 
digital business in North America for the quarter.</p>
<p> In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned the #1 
sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% 
from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers' craving 
experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn 
and scale new features. We know not every one of our new experiences 
will be successful and not all will be scalable but when we do find 
features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we 
deploy them across our global footprint.</p>
<p> In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both 
Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has 
exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and 
responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience
 brought to life in a physical space and uses our most exciting features
 to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and
 by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no 
waiting at a register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and 
special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store.</p>
<p> The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new 
experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal 
home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want 
to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers 
wherever they are. One way we do that with members is to create ways to 
be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which 
will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year, makes 
his on-court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our 
partner mobile apps.</p>
<p> In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a 
QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy 
directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized 
to the way they train.</p>
<p> Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more 
seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of
 the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this 
quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE 
product to be shopped directly from stores, on the Apple Watch, where we
 continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club 
members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE
 through search and Google Assistant.</p>
<p> And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're 
making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot 
Locker, Nordstrom and DICK'S Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences 
are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to 
fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment 
requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, 
we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's 
centered on the consumer. The pillars are demand-sensing and insights, 
so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing 
to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive 
when they want it and connected inventory so they're never disappointed.
 And it starts with better demand sensing and insights.</p>
<p> In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key 
cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher 
full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing 
has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater 
precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials 
drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and 
quality in manufacturing.</p>
<p> To date, more than half of our total footwear production has been 
modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of 
our top 6 manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation 
Center at our world headquarters.</p>
<p> We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an 
example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated
 fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, 
and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day.
 Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days.</p>
<p> And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like 
Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our speed initiatives. In 
support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all 
nonlicensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improved product 
visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to
 point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate 
more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and 
distribution centers.</p>
<p> Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become 
more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide 
coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is 
driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and 
opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has
 high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the
 ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, 
speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world.</p>
<p> Thanks. And now here's Andy</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, NIKE, INC.: Thank you, Mark,
 and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was 
exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral 
revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS 
growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across 
all 4 of our geographies as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, 
women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening 
by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters 
most to consumers globally.</p>
<p> The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct 
Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X 
Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 
key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said
 we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental
 growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation 
platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven 
over 80% of our incremental growth.</p>
<p> Another significant contributor to our growth from a product 
perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that 
Mark calls, editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving
 the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan
 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and 
collaborations for both men and women as well as color and material 
updates through our Express Lane.</p>
<p> Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that 
more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE 
Direct and partnered NIKE experiences, physical and digital, will 
contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace 
undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once 
again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to 
grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency-neutral 
basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with 
consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce 
revenue.</p>
<p> Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our 
time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're 
already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and
 supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the 
consumer closer to real time. For example, product updated and fulfilled
 through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a 
double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as 
Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably
 impacting margins.</p>
<p> 2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging 
automation to a more focused materials pallette and materials staging. 
These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory 
efficiency, a greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we 
are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance
 we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are 
confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward.</p>
<p> While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger 
currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously 
planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year
 '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not 
merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we 
operate at NIKE. One fundamental change is in how we bring innovation to
 market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also 
focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale 
across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an 
extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come, over the balance of fiscal
 year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the
 launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends to 
innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and 
beyond the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p> We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive 
disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long 
term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still 
in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 
3-year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to 
continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those 
capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those 
capabilities through acquisition.</p>
<p> Our 3-year road map also includes the global expansion of our 
digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries where we see the 
greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we 
launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the #1 rated
 shopping app.</p>
<p> Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering
 on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our 
Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights
 even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the 
definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition 
and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to
 inspire and enable a more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for
 athletic footwear and apparel.</p>
<p> There are 4 areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is 
creating outsized opportunities for us: international, digital, apparel 
and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our 
international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than
 in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment 
of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less 
penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport 
participation and culture continue to accelerate in international 
markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best 
current example of this phenomenon.</p>
<p> And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital, owned and 
partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to 
roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking 
bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other 
industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products 
industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be 
well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new 
consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital
 in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with 
digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as 
positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We 
now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the 
majority of our business being digital.</p>
<p> Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at 
NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same 
time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall 
apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic
 is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance 
and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more
 active and expressive lifestyle.</p>
<p> And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of 
sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong 
returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, 
we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more 
aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business. The 
women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, 
women's represents less than 1/4 of NIKE's total revenue. And we're 
already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in 
Q2, but we see step-change growth opportunities ahead by serving women 
more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In
 short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth
 potential long term.</p>
<p> But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's 
reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue 
increased 10%, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. This exceptional 
growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally 
and strong high single-digit growth in North America.</p>
<p> NIKE Digital was the fastest-growing channel in each geography with 
41% growth in aggregate on a currency-neutral basis, again, led by 
mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our 
reported revenue growth than the roughly 3 points we anticipated 90 days
 ago.</p>
<p> We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points 
across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of 
full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus 
being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital 
experiences and platforms.</p>
<p> Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments 
that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel 
long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%.</p>
<p> Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus 
prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, 
reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout 
across all geographies. N</p>
<p> ow let's turn to the financial performance for our reported 
operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported 
and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with 
NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we 
are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a 
reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning 
data-driven, bi-weekly flows of the product to the store with digital 
storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local
 consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member 
acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more 
impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York.</p>
<p> While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going
 through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE 
wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with 
improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as 
Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in 
North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early
 September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the
 NBA season.</p>
<p> We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong 
pipeline of innovative product and digitally [like] consumer experiences
 continuing to fuel strong growth in North America.</p>
<p> In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 
strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE 
Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus 
prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're 
taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of
 the geopolitical dynamics in Europe, that said, we have a long track 
record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of 
macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to
 continue in Europe.</p>
<p> In all 5 of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the #1 cool
 and #1 favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even 
further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers 
locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally.
 For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected 
authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at 
launch around the world.</p>
<p> We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town 
London as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing 
consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store.
 Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping 
experience, driving significant new member acquisition in 2 of our key 
global cities.</p>
<p> Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet again, we delivered 
double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive 
quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth 
accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over
 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important 
market as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app 
community in China -- and recall that the sneakers app was launched just
 last year, is already the same size as our sneakers' community in North
 America.</p>
<p> In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also 
began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded 
physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have
 been extraordinary.</p>
<p> While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China 
relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues 
to win with the consumer in China. For over 3 decades, NIKE has been a 
brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here
 through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through 
partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by 
partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport 
participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, 
leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of
 Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a 
Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the 
campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about 
our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very 
profitable growth in this important geography.</p>
<p> In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with 
balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel as well as 
double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE 
Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We 
also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across 
this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart 
and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, 
testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer 
experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening
 a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our
 connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19
 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by 2 of our strategic 
partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising 
early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would 
otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a 
particular store.</p>
<p> And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral 
basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and
 a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple
 digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged
 in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant 
opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, 
including within Basketball, as well as launching a new digital 
platform.</p>
<p> And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing 
volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is 
certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is 
driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across 
our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what 
matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong 
demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19
 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross 
margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment.</p>
<p> For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth to 
be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double 
digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full
 year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency-neutral
 revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit
 range.</p>
<p> For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full 
year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin 
expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of 
fiscal year '19. We expect SG&amp;A for the full year to grow in the 
high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities 
that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth.</p>
<p> We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50
 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect 
our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That 
said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result
 in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate.</p>
<p> While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course 
of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of 
context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we 
expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth squarely within the high 
single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar 
revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our 
currency-neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 
expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for 
SG&amp;A, we expect growth in the low-double digit range in Q3 as we 
continue to prioritize strategic investment.</p>
<p> And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 
16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving 
consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. 
As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, 
we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform 
the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value 
for shareholders long term.</p>
<p> With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p> LAUREN ELIZABETH CASSEL, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, MORGAN STANLEY, 
RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to ask about gross margin. So 70 basis 
points for the full year and in the third quarter. I think previously, 
you were expecting second half gross margin to be a little bit better 
than the first half. Is there anything that's changed or maybe just 
being a little more conservative given the macro backdrop? That's my 
first question. And then, maybe just talk to us a little bit about how 
much of the 9% growth in North America has been driven by ASP versus 
units? And perhaps given the robust innovation pipeline that you guys 
have, if there's an opportunity for that region to potentially grow a 
little bit faster than 3% or 4% over the long term?</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: All right. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As for 
gross margin, I'll touch on that question first. We are expecting our 
gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you 
note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in
 Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our 
over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and 
momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital as 
well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full 
price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, 
particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved
 outlook for '19 with our expansion being roughly in line with the 
year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when 
we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be 
stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin 
expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in 
any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And 
finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is 
historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the 
expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong 
expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you
 asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up 
across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new 
innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean 
marketplace, are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our 
order book going forward. So very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of
 increase in footwear and in apparel, apparel ASP is even expanding a 
little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I 
said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. 
Operator, we'll take the next question, please.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup.</p>
<p> KATE MCSHANE, MD, HEAD OF THE U.S. DISCRETIONARY AND U.S. APPAREL 
AND RETAIL ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: My question today 
was on Jordan. I know you don't talk or guide the magnitude of growth 
that you expect for a particular line or brand but I wondered if you 
could talk generally the direction of what you expect for Jordan for the
 rest of fiscal year '19? And what are the key drivers that's going to 
be accelerating that growth?</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: Yes. As we said, the growth for Q2 was exceptional 
and we had a great start for Q3, with the largest product launch that 
we've ever had in our history. So that's a good signal right there. I 
think that the great story in Jordan is that we're managing the business
 more holistically between performance, product and retro. It's a clean 
market, a healthy market, particularly in North America. So we're in a 
good pull market situation now. We've got great brand heat, I think, and
 that's really driven by strong product and storytelling. I mentioned 
the Concord of late. The PSG collaboration was a great source of energy 
that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not 
just in Europe, but around the world. So I think the potential in Jordan
 is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the 
enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, including and
 maybe I'll especially call out China there. And then we have more 
potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around 
the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel. So again we're 
actually quite bullish on the future opportunities and continued growth 
for Jordan in the second half and beyond as we move into fiscal '20.</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: Yes, and just to emphasize the point that Mark made,
 Kate, Jordan's growth was strong in the quarter and it was based on 
growth across all geographies. We had strong growth in North America as 
well as, as Mark said, very strong double-digit growth internationally. 
Operator, we'll take the next question, please.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.</p>
<p> ROBERT SCOTT DRBUL, SENIOR MD, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: I guess, just if we could stay on North America for a minute. I
 think you highlighted, I think, athletic specialty a little bit. Is the
 growth in the other channels having an outsized impact on this -- the 
high single-digit in this very strong outlook, can you talk maybe to 
some of the change to yourselves, and how you're doing in that area, 
please?</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: Yes, I think the growth is -- I mean, we feel really
 great about the growth in Digital, as we've stressed continuously in 
our prepared remarks. But we also mentioned the increase on the 
wholesale side beyond expectations there. And I think that's driven by 
the elevation of the experience, the doors with, particularly with Foot 
Locker and DICK'S for example. We're seeing -- where we have invested in
 elevating and differentiating the retail experience for the consumer 
that we're seeing tremendous response. Obviously, the backbone of that 
demand and that response is great product. So we feel really good about 
that in terms of where we've been this first half and then obviously 
with what's coming. But our -- the strategic relationships with our 
bigger partners, who are really investing in the consumer experience, is
 what we're seeing paying off. And we're bullish on that as we move 
forward. But, again, the big driver here is the combination of 
wholesale, including -- in addition to our direct Digital.</p>
<p> ROBERT SCOTT DRBUL: Got it. And I'm just curious if, in the Jordan 
business, there's some momentum there, has -- did the Michael Jordan and
 Malik Monk little exchange, did that help the business at all coming 
out of the quarter? Or has it had no impact?</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: Well, any news is good news in a way. There is -- a little bit of energy is always good. So we'll take it.</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: We'll take the next question, please.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p> PAUL TRUSSELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: Could you just give a little bit more detail on your confident
 outlook outside of North America? Certainly, we see it in the results, 
but certainly, there have also been other companies that have maybe 
flagged incremental discounting or concerns around a slowdown in sneaker
 sales, both in Europe and in China. So if you can just speak in more 
detail to your success there? And then second, if you can just go back 
and maybe talk a bit more about the opportunity for more moderately 
price point products. I think you mentioned it early in your comments. 
Just elaborate on where you see that opportunity from a geography or 
channel or stall opportunity?</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: Yes. Sure. I'll touch on the first part of your 
question related to the momentum in China and Europe in contrast of what
 you referred to as what some others maybe saying in those markets. 
We're seeing extraordinary momentum in both markets. I'd say the 
headline in China is our growth continues to accelerate. We are the #1 
brand with consumers in China. We are a brand of China, deeply connected
 with teams, federations, athletes. And, again, even with the government
 to some extent and the Ministry of Sports in terms of our joint venture
 to fuel sport participation. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for 
our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball 
product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital 
business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership 
with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any 
impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that 
we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of 
being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum
 in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum. 
In both geographies, ASPs are strong, comp store sales are strong, 
closeout mix is low, inventory is healthy. In EMEA, in particular, we're
 taking significant share. That's also amplifying our growth.</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: Yes, the core footwear, let me touch on that 
briefly. We see basically our approach to complete offense. One of the 
things we look at is where are the opportunities on the offense to 
actually grow the business even further than what we see today. And core
 footwear, more excessively priced product in that core footwear zone, 
particularly in North America, but really around the world is a big 
opportunity for us. We're doing well with the business, but we think 
there's more upside opportunity. We wanted to leverage some of the 
platforms that we've introduced more completely with more accessible 
versions of those products for those products within those platforms as 
well as actually creating unique innovation that is targeted towards 
that core, more accessible price point. And actually, amp up our 
storytelling around that product. We think that there's tremendous 
opportunity for us as well there.</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: Operator, we'll take the question, please.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein.</p>
<p> JAMIE SUSAN MERRIMAN, SENIOR ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; 
CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: The first question is, Andy, you talked 
about that 30% Digital target that you laid out at the Investor Day last
 year as maybe more of the mile marker. So I guess, can you talk about 
whether you think you will achieve that faster than what you had laid 
out? And then, what you think that ultimate opportunity is? And you used
 a reference 50% or 80% in other categories, I mean, how you get there? 
And then the second piece is, Mark, you mentioned that you're 
introducing RFID into footwear and nonlicensed apparel. But how will 
that work with your wholesale partners who may or may not all have RFID 
capabilities? And what do you think that will enable NIKE to do?</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: All right. Jamie, I'll touch on your question 
regarding our long-term vision for digital. Frankly, we're not taking a 
year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking 
out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority
 of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries, 
which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, 
not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging 
from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those
 industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. 
And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in 
this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a 
consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples 
of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the 
sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our 
membership program, which we believe is a uniquely compelling 
proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it 
removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our 
consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think driving 
digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with 
leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And 
again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by 
putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze 
the change, not only within our owned store base because that's 
something within our control, but it sets an example for the strategic 
wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we
 would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but
 we see the goals as very achievable when you look at benchmarks in 
other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%.
 It's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go 
well beyond that number over the long term.</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: And quickly on RFIDs, connected inventory is a way 
that will enable us to meet demand -- consumer demand much more 
effectively, more efficiently. We're going to be scaling RFID and 
product, as I mentioned, throughout 2019. We'll be working closely with 
our retail partners, obviously, and obviously all of NIKE Direct so that
 when consumers really are looking for product, we're in a position to 
provide it if it's not in the store that they're looking for. So we 
think that this, as Andy pointed out with the example in North Korea -- 
in Korea, that we think that the opportunity here to affect the consumer
 -- satisfying consumer demand is going to be actually pretty 
significant throughout the year. And that's just going to grow across 
2019. So we're very bullish on that.</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: Operator, I think, we'll take one last question, please.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your last question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel.</p>
<p> JAMES VINCENT DUFFY, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, 
INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great to see the innovation. It's great
 to see the innovation being rewarded with building momentum. I wanted 
to talk a little bit about the Women's business in the context of the 
size of the opportunity, that's very encouraging. What's been the big 
unlock with the recent success? I'm sure there's more to it than just 
the Edit to Amplify. Are you speaking to female consumers in a different
 way? Or is there some sort of structural or cultural tailwind that's 
strengthened recently?</p>
<p> MARK G. PARKER: Well, as we mentioned, women's is outpacing men's 
growth for the quarter, and we see that continuing as we move forward 
through the fiscal year and beyond. I think there's a number of factors.
 I think women are embracing sneaker culture. We're seeing that with 
some of the iconic franchises that we've had like the Air Force 1 that 
are actually designed specifically for women with deeper insights that, I
 think, resonate. And that's one example, but that's true across the 
product offering. Using the insights that we gain in that connection 
that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and
 we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that
 we've introduced in apparel, Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was 
another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's 
relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the 
foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually 
speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my 
remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head 
towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on
 women's. And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way 
that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world. There's a real 
appetite for more active lifestyle and that's affecting fashion and what
 -- the product that we're creating is more sensitive to that and we're 
seeing the response from that work.</p>
<p> JAMES VINCENT DUFFY: And you mentioned women's 25% of the business 
globally, can you speak about how that shakes out across the regions?</p>
<p> ANDREW CAMPION: Sure. It's relatively evenly distributed across the 
regions. And from a categorical perspective, it's largely comprised 
sportswear, running and training, which is in part why it's relatively 
well distributed across the regions. In terms of the rate of growth, 
it's outpacing in all geos, outpacing the men's business. Now in terms 
of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous 
momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our 
vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer-term. The women's 
footwear and apparel market is 1.5x the size of the men's footwear and 
apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than 1/4 of our 
revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong 
growth and even step-change growth as we really do 2 things, open the 
aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again that's with a sharp 
focus on women and movement and activity. And then second, editing and 
more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's 
opportunity. So in short, we've got great momentum in the women's 
business, but we're chasing something much bigger. Thank you, Jim. Okay,
 that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Happy holidays. We'll speak with you next quarter.</p>

Tim.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, REV GROUP,INC.:</b>
 Thank you, Sandy, and thanks, everyone, for joining us ontoday's call. 
To say that fiscal 2018 was a challenge would be anunderstatement. Quite
 frankly, anything that could go wrong, did gowrong and then some. It 
was particularly frustrating since many ofthe issues were out of our 
control. Detroit manufacturing shuttingdown for 3 weeks due to a fire at
 a key supplier was only one of themany highly unusual situations. We 
responded as quickly as possibleto everything that came our way, we 
reacted quickly to the dramaticsupplier price increases in the second 
quarter and then supply chainand material availability challenges that 
continue into our firstquarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>Slide 4 of today's presentation depicts some details regarding 
theextended lead times of certain product groups, due to the 
compoundingeffect of the numerous tariffs as they were instituted. You 
can'tbuild what you don't have and you can't ship what you can't 
build.We've had to continually adapt to the ever changing material 
leadtimes.</p>
<p>Slide 4 also shows the challenges around chassis availability. As 
youcan see only Ford has returned to what would be considered normallead
 times. We are effectively managing through allocations by somechassis 
suppliers, but delays in Mercedes Benz chassis in particular,will 
continue to a negatively impact our shipments in Q1 2019.</p>
<p>We expect chassis availability to continue improving through thefirst
 half of fiscal year 2019, but other material availabilityissues are 
likely to persist. A significant amount of small partsthat we use in our
 vehicles have historically been sourced fromChina. The Trump tariffs 
set on 818 categories of goods imported fromChina has indirectly put 
pressure on our traditional U.S. supplierswho are being asked to 
substitute thousands of parts which havetransitioned to China. As you 
can imagine, these challenges have beendifficult to predict, and our 
average lead times have increasedsignificantly on many products as a 
result. We are exploring and --opportunities to source products from new
 suppliers, and we're alsoimplementing strategies to improve 
manufacturing output includingadditional shifts in some of our 
facilities and other improvements inmanufacturing processes.</p>
<p>As a reminder, on last quarter's call, we had indicated that 
materialand chassis issues have resulted in deferrals of approximately 
$120million in revenue into 2019, split about evenly between 
ambulance,commercial buses and specialty vehicles. We experienced 
meaningfullabor inefficiencies in our Fire segment during Q4 due to new 
hires,compensation adjustments, roster changes as well as changes in 
ourovertime policies. Accordingly, approximately $40 million in 
firetruck shipments will move into fiscal 2019, bringing our 
totaldeferred shipments from 2018 to 2019 to approximately $160 million.</p>
<p>I always say never squander a good crisis and this one has been 
noexception. As our shipping performance slowed due to the lack 
ofchassis and material, we were able to review our operations to 
findareas of waste and significantly reduce our corporate 
overheadexpenses. This will make us a better company moving forward. 
Duringthe fourth quarter, we experienced year-over-year backlog growth 
ineach of our operating segments, including that the underlying 
demandfor our products remains very strong. Moreover, we experienced 
nocancellations for any orders in our backlog, confirming thestickiness 
of our numerous customer relationships, whichsignificantly improves our 
chances to affect meaningful recovery infiscal 2019.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing challenges, we began to see improvements in 
thepace of delayed shipments through the end of fiscal 2018, and 
weexpect supply chain and material availability challenges to 
beginnormalizing during the first half of next year. In essence, 
we'veadapted to the new normal, and we have learned to manage 
expectationsand schedule our manufacturing accordingly. We are 
optimistic thatour ability to ship will improve progressively as we move
 through theyear.</p>
<p>Slide 13 in our presentation provides guidance as to how we expectour
 shipments and therefore, our earnings to progress as we movethrough the
 year compared to how we performed in 2017 and 2018. As wehead into the 
new year, we're focused on driving margin expansionwithin our Fire &amp;
 Emergency segment through operatingefficiencies, increased production 
capacity and continued organicgrowth. All of our fire brands have 
growing backlogs in both KME andfor our improving margins, which should 
drive segment profitabilityhigher long-term.</p>
<p>In our Commercial segment, the LA County contract will serve as 
astrong base for our transit bus business beginning in 2019. Based 
ongrowing backlogs, we're also anticipating higher production 
andprofitability per school bus, shuttle bus and terminal trucks as 
weprogress through the year. In recreation, our acquisitions of 
Lance,Renegade and Midwest all continued to perform very well 
withmeaningful backlogs and the reposition of our Class A product 
linehas been designed to help us reach our adjusted EBITDA margin 
targetof 10%.</p>
<p>In addition to our focus on driving growth, we are placing a 
highpriority on cash generation. We have revised our 
incentivecompensation programs to align with this important objective. 
Asnoted in yesterday's earnings release, we have identified a series 
ofassets that we believe could generate approximately $40 million incash
 through divestiture in the near- to medium-term time horizon,and we 
recorded a $36.5 million noncash impairment charge related tothese 
actions to pave the way for this cash generation to occur.</p>
<p>We have communicated several times that if we don't believe we 
canachieve a 10% EBITDA margin for a particular product line then wewill
 take action. That is the case with our Revability product line.We just 
signed a definitive agreement to sell our Revability productline 
yesterday. We expect this transaction to close this week. Wehave many 
reasons to feel confident about our ability to return togrowth in fiscal
 2019, including the benefits of our recentlyimplemented price 
increases, cost reductions, restructuringinitiatives and managing to the
 new normal in our supply chain. Wehave an excellent collection of 
brands and products and our status asthe industry leader in high-end 
luxury vehicles and critical productsfor commercial municipal government
 customers should enable us tocreate compelling long-term value for our 
shareholders. Speaking ofincreasing shareholder value, REV group 
delivered approximately $66.1million in direct returns to shareholders 
in 2018 through sharerepurchases and dividends. And we will remain 
committed to drivingstrong returns to shareholders in fiscal 2019 with a
 renewed focus oncash generation and return on invested capital.</p>
<p>Now I'll turn the call over to Dean, for a detailed review of thefinancials.</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN, CFO, REV GROUP, INC.:</b> Thanks, Tim, and good 
morning.Starting with Slide 5, I will review our consolidated fourth 
quarterresults and segment level performance. For the sake of time, I'll
 notspecifically be addressing full year result on today's call, 
butwe've provided full year slides for both consolidated and 
segmentlevel performance in the Appendix of today's presentation.</p>
<p>As Tim discussed, during the fourth quarter, we continued 
toexperience ongoing headwinds from the supply chain inefficienciesthat 
were created in the wake of the recent implementation of tariffsbetween 
the U.S. and other countries. And a number of other onetimeimpacts also 
contributed to lower year-over-year profitability.</p>
<p>Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $660 million, 
down3.5%, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This decline 
wasdriven by lower Fire &amp; Emergency segment sales due to 
missedshipments of both ambulances and fire products during the 
quarter,partially offset by sales growth in commercial and 
recreationsegments. Excluding the benefit of the Lance acquisition in 
thequarter, consolidated net sales were 8.3% lower than the prior 
yearperiod.</p>
<p>GAAP net loss for the quarter was $22 million or $0.35 per 
dilutedshare, which was driven lower due a one-time noncash 
impairmentcharge of $35.6 million that we recognized during the quarter.
 Thischarge was due to the adjustment of a net realizable value of 
certainbusinesses, product lines and assets to their estimated 
divestiturecash value as well as the impairment of certain information 
systemassets.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter adjusted net income decreased from $29.3 million 
to$17.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share. This decrease in adjustednet
 income was driven by the lower operating results and higherinterest 
expense.</p>
<p>Starting on Page 6 of our slide deck. I'll move now to a review ofthe performance of each of our segments.</p>
<p>Fire &amp; Emergency segment sales decreased by 21% to $251 
millionfor the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this decline 
werefirst, the anticipated impacts of continued chassis 
supplychallenges, resulting in lower shipments of ambulances, plus 
inaddition, we experienced temporary labor inefficiencies at 2 of 
ourFire division plants, which caused us to miss valuable 
productionslots for approximately 80 fire trucks representing 
approximately $40million in sales value. In our current environment, for
 the Firedivision, where we have backlog extending out 1 year or more, 
when wemiss the window of production opportunity like we did, we have 
toincrease capacity and ramp up production going forward to catch up 
ondeliveries or else the backlog in the revenue stream just shifts tothe
 right. In this case, we expect to recover most of our missedshipments 
in 2019 with new production slots and increased capacity.The Fire 
division is increasing its production capacity throughfacilities and 
production floor improvements, but also mostimportantly through an 
increase in labor and in some cases theadditional -- the addition of 
work shifts. Based on the schedule forthe implementation of these</p>
<p>(technical difficulty)</p>
<p>in the quarter, but was also impacted by the temporary and result 
oflabor inefficiencies in the Fire division, which are estimated tohave 
cost the segment approximately $6 million in productioninefficiencies 
and direct project cost during the quarter. Thesenegative impacts were 
partially offset by lower selling, general andadministrative expenses in
 the segment. F&amp;E segment adjustedEBITDA margin was 500- basis 
points lower compared to prior yearquarter as a result of these items. 
Despite the short-term challengeswe are experiencing in this segment, we
 expect our leadershippositions in F&amp;E, our backlogs and strong 
distributionpartnerships to support return to sales growth and margin 
expansionin fiscal 2019 and over the long-term.</p>
<p>Both fire and ambulance markets are central products 
formunicipalities and should continue experiencing the benefits 
ofpositive macro trends including urbanization and aging 
population.Backlog in this segment increased 20% to $708 million, 
compared tothe end of fiscal 2017, and was up 17% sequentially.</p>
<p>As shown on Slide 7, in our Commercial segment, quarterly sales 
wereup 3.4% compared to the prior year period, driven by an increase 
inthe number of shuttle bus and specialty vehicle units sold comparedto 
the prior year. In addition, our Collins Subsidiary began to shipthe 
first buses under its contract with New York in the quarter. 
Thisquarter-over-quarter increase in sales for this segment was 
realizeddespite the ongoing chassis availability and material 
shortagesexperienced in the quarter by our shuttle bus and 
specialtydivisions.</p>
<p>Commercial adjusted EBITDA declined to $9.6 million from $14.8million
 in the prior year quarter with the decrease primarilyattributable to 
the continued supply chain challenges, which impactedtiming of shipments
 and unfavorable product mix as a result of lowertransit bus shipments 
and higher volumes of shuttle bus units.Adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.3% 
was down 300- basis points in thequarter as a result of these items. 
Commercial backlog at the end ofthe fourth quarter was up 4% to $381 
million compared to the end offiscal 2017 and was down 9% sequentially, 
which is seasonallyconsistent with prior years.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing complications of commercial chassis availability, 
webelieve the fundamentals of our markets are solid. We are 
expectingmuch stronger performance in the commercial segment in 2019, 
givenour backlog visibility and expected return to relative normalcy 
inthe supply chains. Specifically, we expect greater sales volumes 
ofboth transit buses and commercial school buses next year, whichshould 
provide a significant tailwind for both sales andprofitability in this 
segment given their strong margincharacteristics.</p>
<p>Turning to Slide 8. Our bright spot for the quarter was ourRecreation
 segment. Quarterly sales in Recreation segment grew 25%year-over-year 
to $235 million, driven by strong performance of ourClass B and Class C 
products as well as the benefit of ouracquisition of Lance. Even 
excluding the impact of Lance, Recreationsegment net sales increased by 
$14 million or 7% compared to theprior year period. Recreation adjusted 
EBITDA increased 51% for thequarter to $21.8 million. The increase was 
due to continued increasesin profitability in our Class B, Class C and 
Goldshield businesses inaddition to the dollar and margin benefit from 
the acquisition ofLance. On an organic basis, excluding Lance, 
recreation adjustedEBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 15% and 60- 
basis pointscompared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Segment 
backlogincreased 100% to $291 million versus the end of fiscal 2017, and
 wasup 15% sequentially compared to the third quarter.</p>
<p>We believe our leadership position in the high-end luxury channels 
ofthe recreation market should enable us to outperform the 
industrylonger term, and we've also been encouraged with supportive 
feedbackfrom customers regarding our recent efforts to realign our Class
 Aproduct. We believe our distribution channel is healthy with 
capacityfor additional units, and we feel confident about this 
businessheading into the next buying season, early next calendar year.</p>
<p>Now please turn to Slide 9, where we've provided a bridge 
frommidpoint of last quarter's fiscal year 2018 adjusted EBITDA 
guidanceto our actual performance. You can see based on this waterfall 
chartthat the issue of the temporary labor inefficiencies in Fire, 
whichcaused production cost inefficiencies and missed production 
slotswere the largest impacts to us in the quarter and were obviously 
notanticipated or expected as we guided towards our full 
yearexpectation.</p>
<p>Nothing can be viewed in a vacuum but absent this issue, which 
isbehind us, we would have realized a full year adjusted EBITDA 
resultmuch closer to our original expectations. Our RV acquisitions 
overthe past few years continue to pay dividends and provide lift in 
ourprofitability whereas the material and chassis supply chainchallenges
 continue to impact our businesses through fiscal year andinto the first
 quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>Slide 10 provides a review of recent trends in working capital. As 
weexpected, we saw a seasonal sequential decrease in net workingcapital 
in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease ininventory levels 
from the normal seasonal high we experienced duringthe third quarter. 
But this working capital reduction was not assignificant as in prior 
years. The increase in working capital versusthe prior year quarter was 
partially due to the acquisition of Lance,but more significantly was due
 to the indirect impact onwork-in-process inventory from the chassis 
availability and theextension of material lead times.</p>
<p>Improving working capital and inventory turns will be an 
importantarea of focus for us next year. And due to specific initiatives
 inour operations as well as the improvement in our supply 
chainefficiencies, we are forecasting that we will generate cash 
fromworking capital in fiscal 2019, and we will make progress toward 
amore meaningful long-term opportunity to permanently reduce 
workingcapital requirements over the next few years. We expect this 
willgenerate meaningful amount of debt reduction and even 
betterliquidity.</p>
<p>Net debt at October 31, 2018 was $410 million with $137 million 
ofavailability under our ABL revolving credit facility. Our netleverage 
ratio at the end of the fiscal year 2018, was 2.8x. Thisincrease in debt
 year-over-year was a result of our working capitalposition at the end 
of the year, as I previously discussed, but alsobecause of our 
acquisition of Lance and capital expenditureinvestments plus our buyback
 of $53 million worth of our own stockduring fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>As Tim mentioned earlier -- and we are laser-focused on this -- 
weexpect to improve the strength of our balance sheet over the 
comingyear not only by cash from operations but also by generating 
cashthrough specific initiatives including the divestitures of 
certainbusinesses, product lines or other nonperforming assets, which 
havenow classified as held-for-sale and have an active program 
tomonetize during fiscal 2019, wherein we expect to 
generateapproximately $40 million of additional cash for debt reduction.
 Werecorded a $36 million noncash impairment charge partially to 
adjustfor the fair value of these assets during the fourth quarter as 
weimplement our liquidation plans.</p>
<p>We expect to use cash proceeds to reduce debt. But we should notethat
 given expectations for continued supply chain challenges in thebusiness
 during the first quarter of fiscal '19, we anticipate anincrease in our
 leverage ratio through the end of the first quarter.We have 
historically said that we would prefer to stay below 2.5xleverage, but 
we feel comfortable being above that level at presentand into the first 
quarter given the transitory impact of the supplychain inefficiencies 
we're experiencing, and we expect to reduceleverage by more than 1 full 
turn by the end of fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>On Slide 11 we show our capital allocation over the last 5 
quarters.Capital expenditures were $8.7 million in the fourth quarter 
comparedto $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Company 
repurchased atotal of 519,000 of its common shares for $7.8 million 
during thefourth quarter at an average repurchase price of $14.96 a 
share. AsTim mentioned, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares 
duringfiscal 2018 for total consideration of $53 million representing 
anaverage purchase price of $16.47 per share.</p>
<p>In addition to shares repurchased, we distributed $12.8 million 
toshareholders in the form of dividends bringing total cash returned 
infiscal 2018 to approximately $66 million.</p>
<p>Now turn the slide -- please turn to Slide 12 for a review of 
ouroutlook fiscal 2019. We are estimating net sales for fiscal 2019 
inthe range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion representing a 
5%year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Net income is estimated to 
be$43 million to $63 million representing a significant 
increaseyear-over-year due to the impairment and restructuring done in 
fiscal2018. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 
$150million to $170 million representing an 8% year-over-year growth 
atthe midpoint. We're planning on $25 million to $30 million in 
capitalexpenditures and net cash from operations of $110 million to 
$130million. This guidance for cash from operations is new for REV and 
isa testament to our focus and commitment to improving cash 
generation.Cash and cash generation is now a component of our 
managementincentive plan for fiscal 2019. And this forecast represents 
anincrease of over $120 million of cash from operations compared to 
thefiscal 2018.</p>
<p>Our forecast for interest expense is estimated to be in the range 
of$29 million to $31 million due to the impact of floating 
rateincreases. And our effective tax rate should settle into a 
post-taxreform range of 25% to 27%. Implied in the totality of our 
guidancefor fiscal 2019, is also a meaningful improvement in our return 
oninvested capital metric. Absent the impacts of any potential 
futureacquisition activity, we are targeting approximately $100 million 
indebt reduction during fiscal 2019, which would reduce our 
leverageratio, as I said earlier, by 1 turn by year-end. We expect 
thestrength of our financial performance to be weighted towards the 
backhalf of the fiscal year in-line with historical trends. And given 
theongoing challenges we expect to persist in the first quarter, 
weexpect lower Q1 performance in 2019 as compared to the prior 
yearquarter.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize and mention the 
factthat REV Group completed year one of its Sarbanes–Oxley 
compliancejourney in fiscal 2018. And as you can see in our Form 10-Q --
 10-Kfiled yesterday afternoon, REV received a clean opinion on 
internalcontrols from our independent public accounting firm for the 
year.This was no small challenge or accomplishment for our younger 
publiccompany. This was not just a success with regard to compliance, 
butmuch more importantly, it is essential to becoming a stronger 
companyby integrating strong internal controls and oversight over 
ourbusinesses as we grow. This makes us better as a company, and 
we'rethankful to our teams for their dedication and commitment to 
oursuccess in this area.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn the call back to Tim for some closing comments.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Thanks, Dean. In closing, while 
fiscal 2018was challenging, fundamental demand across our end-markets 
remainstrong. Most of our product lines are continuing to show a high 
levelof order activity and we have many reasons to believe that 
we'veentered fiscal 2019 poised for improved revenue growth and 
margins.Our supply chain challenges are being effectively managed, 
andhopefully many of the short-term issues will soon be behind us. 
Wewill have the full benefit of price increases and 
restructuringinitiatives implemented in 2018 as we progress to 2019. We 
have agrowing backlog, a leaner product portfolio and 
improvingproductivity and manufacturing efficiency, and we expect to 
generatea meaningful level of cash in fiscal 2019. We are very grateful 
forthe continued dedication and support of our employees, 
customers,partners and shareholders, and we're looking forward to a 
successfulyear together in fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>Operator, we'd now like to open it up to questions.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from theline of Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse.</p>
<p>JAMIE LYN COOK, MD, SECTOR HEAD OF UNITED STATES CAPITAL 
GOODSRESEARCH, AND ANALYST, CRéDIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I 
guessa couple of questions on the outlook for 2019. First, just given 
thebacklog growth that you've had and the deferral of revenues from 
'18to '19, I would've thought your top-line growth would've been 
higher.So can you talk to how much of it is being impacted by sort of 
thesupplier issues that you guys spoke about or your own internalissues?
 And then my next question, I would've also thought thatEBITDA guide 
would've been better as I think of '19 versus '18. Socan you talk us 
through the big puts-and-takes? How much we'reassuming for savings, 
price costs, what the disposal of the $40million? How much that impacts 
the EBITDA as well as laborefficiencies or mix, if you could just help 
us through that?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes. But let me address at least 
theperspective on how we set guidance, Jamie. I think clearly, we 
weresurprised by our lack of performance in the fourth quarter based 
onthe fact that we couldn't get the chassis, we couldn't get 
thematerial. So as I made the statement in my comments, we're trying 
tomeasure expectations to make sure that we can manage through 
thesituation we're in. I think we understand very well now the leadtimes
 that we're dealing with, chassis availability. But we alsodon't want to
 be surprised. So our projection is somewhatconservative. I think 
they're realistic based on the modeling thatwe've done for both the 
revenue and earnings. And Dean, you may wantto comment on the $40 
million?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Yes. So from the standpoint of the deferrals 
ordelays or missed production slots, primarily missed production 
slotswould in the Fire division. As Tim said, that was $160 million 
inrevenue pushed into 2019. $40 million of that is Fire, and we 
don'texpect to be able to start recouping that $40 million, 80 or 
sotrucks until into the second quarter or at the end of the 
secondquarter. And the key there is, we have a full backlog and 
fullcapacity with 1 shift primarily. And in order to start to catch up 
onthat delay, we need to add capacity, and we're in process of doingthat
 now at our facilities so that we can start to catch up on thosetrucks 
in the second quarter of 2019 and going forward. On theambulances and 
the buses, which is the $120 million, we should startto see that later 
in the end of Q1 through Q3. Maybe, Jamie, steppingback to some of the 
big ticket items for next year. We talked aboutthe restructuring charges
 we took in the second quarter of 2018,benefiting us to the tune of $20 
million year-over-year annually incost reductions, we will see that next
 year. We saw $10 million of itin the second half of this year, we're 
going to see the other $10million incremental next year. Our price-cost 
equation should bepositive based upon our estimates, generating maybe 
approximately100- basis points of gross margin next year, price versus 
cost. Wewill have some headwinds from labor inflation expectations, 
otherlabor -- other inflationary expectations for overhead, et cetera. 
Andwe'll have some incentive comp headwinds next year where we expect 
topay that next year, but haven't paid this year.</p>
<p><b>JAMIE LYN COOK:</b> Okay. Just one follow-up question. Just 
strategicallyobviously, you announced the sale of some assets this 
morning. Sosort of what else is on the table? And then Tim, as I'm just 
thinkingabout the strategy relative to when you guys IPO-ed, it was to 
beconsolidator in the space, like how do I balance that with the 
viewthat there is -- does that strategy still work with the 
balancingthat with there's more divestitures potentially on the table?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Well, we're going to keep what we 
think wecan drive forward and we're going to, I guess, jettison the 
assetsthat we don't think are going to provide us that type of return. 
I'llgive you an example, we're selling our Alvarado RTC for 
approximately$12 million. That facility has not provided us the return 
that wewant and the return that we projected. And it's on the block and 
thatwill be $12 million to the good. As far as our path going forward, 
wecontinue to -- we plan to continue to consolidate within 
ourindustries. We're going to be very prudent, though, what we doacquire
 and it's not -- we haven't left the playing field. We stillhave at 
least 3 or 4 potential targets that we review on a regularbasis. But we 
are going to be very discerning in what we do investin. It's about 
making money, and we're going to make sure we'remaking money, if we've 
made a misstep, we're going to self-correctthat, especially in this 
market that we're in right now.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady withSunTrust.</p>
<p><b>CHARLES DAMIEN BRADY, MD, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 Just on the RV side of the business, you mentioned a littlebit in your 
prepared remarks on the kind of the inventory levelwithin the dealers. 
But could you expand upon that as to what thedealer inventory level 
looks like right now? It sounds like theindustry data itself is a little
 bit soft over the past couple ofmonths.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes, the retail market's been off 
andaccordingly the wholesale market has followed that. We're not --we're
 getting, I think, some pretty positive feedback from ourdealers. I 
think they're being cautious. I think there was anoversupply into the 
industry, it was rocking forward at double-digitgrowth and I think it 
started to slow. And I think with that slowingof the retail market, 
people have already pulled back on thewholesale side. People are still 
cautiously optimistic. We're goinginto our buying season here in 
January, and that's going to be thatthe tell-tail sign. But dealers have
 been running down theirinventories. Having said that, our Bs, Cs and 
Towables still havebetween 9 and 12 month backlogs. So those 3 product 
groups, we arecontinuing to ship to dealers based on the backlog. There 
have notbeen any cancellations, they continue to take that product. The 
A'shave been a little bit soft in the last -- actually the last year.And
 that we think is going to continue until we see some meaningfulretail 
activity as we get into the buying season here in January. SoI think 
probably a little bit of oversupply as the market is startingto cool 
off. People have taken action to slow ordering down, and Ithink we're 
all very anxious to see how the buying season kicks offhere in the next 
couple of weeks.</p>
<p><b>CHARLES DAMIEN BRADY:</b> And then switching on the Fire side. 
Yourcommentary about having done -- I'm trying to get the catch up on 
thepushed out trucks having to add extra shifts extra labor. I'm 
justwondering from a margin perspective on that segment as you ramp 
upthese -- essentially cost to try to catch up on that revenue, shouldwe
 expect sort of at least a near-term or maybe a couple of quarterdip in 
the margin of that business until it evens out with theproduction 
levels?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes, good observation. I think 
that'sexactly right, Charlie. We have done a couple of things. We 
haveimproved our health care cost, our health care benefits I should 
say,which obviously has had a somewhat of a decrease or an increase 
inour cost. We've actually improved our hourly rates to make sure 
we'reattracting good talent. I think the good news is, we're putting 
aback shift on in Ocala. We had a job fair last week. We had 200people 
show up for the job fair and we filled that shift. We wouldn'thave been 
able to do that unless we improved, quite frankly, ourhourly rate and 
our health care benefits. So there will be a littlebit of pressure on 
margins in the near-term, but nothing meaningful.I know we're not 
talking significant reductions in margin, but it isgoing to have some 
cost increases that we think are completelyappropriate -- and then 
actions, we had to take. I think -- I tellyou the other thing we've done
 and it's actually had a big positiveimpact is, we've run our Fire 
businesses with mandatory overtime forthe last 3 years. And it's because
 the backlog has been high. We'vebeen working people really hard. The 
interesting thing is, when wetook mandatory overtime off and put it as 
voluntary overtime, wehaven't seen a decrease in overtime, it's been 
flat. But people arechoosing versus us dictating to them, and that's had
 a very, verypositive effect on our labor in our Fire segment too. So I 
think ourproductivity is going to be a nice bump up. Our cost will be a 
littlebit higher, but we think that it will be more than offset 
withhopefully the efficiencies we're going to get as we move into 
fiscal2019.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre withRobert W. Baird.</p>
<p><b>MIRCEA DOBRE, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO.INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I'm still scratching my head alittle bit on your EBITDA guidance, and 
maybe Dean or Tim you canhelp me with this. But you're essentially at 
the mid-point guidingfor an additional $12 million of EBITDA. You 
mentioned you areexpecting $10 million of incremental savings, you're 
talking aboutprice cost contributing a 100 bps so that's, what, north of
 $20million. I do know that there were a number of issues that you've 
hadin fiscal '18. Some of them you called them in the fourth quarter 
tothe tune of $12 million, right? I think through -- Q1 through Q3 
youhad something like $18 million worth of chassis-related headwinds. 
SoI guess -- I'm looking for some help to bucket, if you would, as tohow
 we're getting to $12 million? Where are the drags that are stilllasting
 into fiscal '19?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Yes, I mean, I would say those numbers that 
you threwout are fairly accurate. One thing is, sitting here -- we don't
 wantto be sitting here again next year with deferrals and 
delays,unexpected items that we explain away. So we're estimating 
thatthere's going to be some of those things that might continue. 
We'regoing to work our tails off to not let those things continue. 
Butwe're working towards making sure that we don't surprise thedownside.
 So I think that's one thing to take into consideration. Andthese 
material and supply chain issues aren't completely behind usand the 
tariffs/inflationary pressures are still kind of out there inthe public 
sector with a lot of noise today and so you can't predictthat. So I 
think those things -- couple of those things.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> It's not -- we're not in an 
environment yetMig, without surprises. We were moving into our LA 
contract and onlyto find that we couldn't get windows. And we lost some 
shipments inthe month of November. And those that were stretched into 
December,we think we'll catch up in January. These are the types of 
surprisesthat come out at us every single day, and until the market 
reallysettles down to the point that we feel we got consistent 
materialsupply and consistent chassis supply, we're going to be 
cautious. Andit really gets down to that. I think you've done the math 
right.Those are all potential big plusses for us as we go through 
there.But for every plus, there seems to always be a negative that hits 
us,and we're being cautious.</p>
<p><b>MIRCEA DOBRE:</b> Well, I appreciate that but if you're saying 
that mymath is fairly correct than what we're talking about here is a 
prettysizable hole or drag, if you would, that you had from a myriad 
ofcosts that you're essentially assuming into fiscal '19. And I 
guess,what I'm trying to figure out is, how much of this will be an 
ongoingissue? Like for instance, your labor inflation and health care 
cost,those aren't going to go away, they are just part of how we 
operateversus things that can eventually work themselves out, right? 
Andthen additionally, what is it that gives you more confidence in -- 
orvisibility into this chassis issue than what you've had say 3 monthsor
 6 months ago? Because this is not a new issue, you've beenstruggling 
with it throughout the second half of '18?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Well, the chassis, I will start from
 theback and work forward. On the chassis side, the reason we're 
actuallyperforming a little bit better, I think, as we move through the 
yearas we've been able to shift people on the Ford chassis. I'll give 
youan example. We can't get Dodge chassis, still can't. We've been 
ableto effectively move our customers off of Dodge onto Ford. The 
1customer base that is a little bit difficult to move off of 
thoseMercedes-Benz, when they want Mercedes-Benz, they want 
Mercedes-Benz.And we're just struggling to get those chassis right now 
and for anumber of reasons, and we don't see light at the end of the 
tunneluntil we get well into the second quarter on that. I think, if 
youlook at -- in the chart that we did, we did it because we think 
it'sfactual. This thing doesn't self-correct quickly. It's -- we 
thoughtokay, we're going to be able to muscle through the fourth quarter
 andwe'll be fine as we get into fiscal '19. You can see what we see 
inthe first quarter. A year-over-year comparison looks bad and becauseit
 is bad. We're not going to be even close to where we were in '17and '18
 and then really down quarter, even with a lot of carryoverfrom '18 as 
far as backlog. I think as we progress through the yearand the surprises
 on the material side settle down to the point thatwe're comfortable, 
we'll take another look at guidance. We've got alot of levers that we 
can pull and things that we think we canimprove. We've laid them all out
 there and for every positive we hopethere's not a negative to pull us 
down but it's conservative, we'llobviously revisit it every quarter and 
keep you advised on how we'reprogressing through our plan.</p>
<p><b>MIRCEA DOBRE:</b> I appreciate it. One last, if I may. Just trying
 tounderstand how you're thinking at segment level on revenue. 
You'retalking about catching up on $40 million in Fire &amp; 
Emergency,that's good. You're talking about starting to ship on the LA 
busorder in Commercial, so that's going to give you some growth. Itseems
 to me like your guidance implies your RV business being down.Am I right
 about that? How are you thinking about it?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> No, RV's not going to be down, RV is
 goingto be up, Because of the backlog that we've got. And the good news
 Ithink is on the B, Cs and Towables. We had significant cost 
increaseson those back in the second quarter. But the material's 
flowingfairly well in the RV industry right now, primarily due to the 
factthat a lot of the RV manufacturers have had their backlog 
shrink,which means that material availability in RV is probably some of 
ourbest availability. There's not the demand that there was 6 monthsago.
 So that's pretty good. I think -- we think we will grow RV, thebacklogs
 are great. Across the board, our issues by and large, havenothing to do
 with backlog. We got more work that we're faced withright now, which is
 absolutely the most positive thing we've gotgoing for us. It's just a 
matter of getting the material and thenexecuting on getting the things 
to the plant. And we'll get there,but RV will grow this year.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Levich withGoldman Sachs.</p>
<p><b>BENJAMIN J. BURUD, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC.,RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. Tim, in the firetruck business, can you
 just elaborate on which facilities drove theshortfall? And where do 
daily production rates stand today comparedto maybe June or July? The 
concern is that when we've seen productionissues like this in the fire 
truck industry in the past, that they'veultimately taken years to 
resolve. Can you kind of help us maybequantify the ultimate risk and 
that -- if that's the case here?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> The 2 plants that really had the 
mostissues were our KME plant in Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania, which is 
KMEand E-ONE in Ocala, Florida. E-ONE, by far has the biggest backlogand
 that's the plant that we've put the back shift on and we just putthat 
on. But we'll work through, and I think we're looking at asignificant 
increase in units out of all 3 of our plants, but inparticular, Ocala 
this year, which has the biggest backlog. The goodnews is, if we get a 
backlog that doesn't go away, we just have towhittle it down and get it 
down. We've got a 14-month backlog inOcala right now, which is too much 
and with this back shift, we'llknow certainly as we work through our 
first quarter, what ouropportunities are to make those shipments. But 
we're optimistic, wenot pessimistic that we can't hit our shipments and 
actually whittlethat backlog down a little bit.</p>
<p><b>BENJAMIN J. BURUD:</b> All right. And then you called out Fire 
&amp;Emergency price increases in the release. Can you please give us 
anidea to the magnitude and timing of any set increases? How much 
youexpect will stick? And what, if any other, actions you've 
seencompetitors take?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Well first, we've had price 
increasesacross the board. Everything's engaged in price increases 
includingRV and Commercial, and we've done that, obviously, to react to 
thesignificant price increases we've got in the second quarter, whichwas
 a huge spike and the ongoing material cost increases. Theyhaven't been 
nearly to the magnitude they were in the second quarterin Q3 and Q4, but
 we have seen increases. And I think the good newsis, we believe that 
with the price increases that we put out thereimmediately back in the 
second quarter and what we put out there nowin the third and fourth 
quarter, that we're ahead of the costincreases that we're getting with 
materials. It's not good enoughjust to run with the material cost 
increases, you got to get ahead ofthem as well. So the price increases 
have been across the board, andwe think that we've been able to keep -- 
we've got ourselvespositioned well now, we think, to stay ahead of it.</p>
<p><b>BENJAMIN J. BURUD:</b> So just to clarify, so is it fair to say 
that the100 bp price cost tailwind next year, that there is more risk on
 thecost side than there is on the pricing side?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes, that's a fair statement.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from theline of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW MILLARD CASEY, SENIOR MACHINERY ANALYST, WELLS FARGOSECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I'd just like to ask a fewquestions around operating cash flow. First a
 clarification. Does the$110 million, $130 million guide -- and thanks 
for providing that, bythe way -- does that include any gain on asset 
sales or is it -- ismost of the improvement versus this year mainly a 
swing to positiveworking capital contribution versus the $115 million 
assumptionduring '18?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Andy, that includes both. It's not a gain per 
se,it's just the cash from -- the total cash from the opportunities 
aswell as generating positive cash from working capital and 
thenearnings. But it's the GAAP line item, net cash from operations.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW MILLARD CASEY:</b> Okay. So that -- I'm sorry, Dean, that wouldinclude the $40 million anticipated cash inflow?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Yes, it does.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW MILLARD CASEY:</b> Okay. And then the comments about Q1 
leveragegoing up a little bit, that implies, obviously it's probably 
going tobe negative. I'm just wondering how negative? Should we expect 
it tobe above or beneath what you did in Q1 '18?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Oh, yes, you say OC meaning operating cash flow inthe first quarter.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW MILLARD CASEY:</b> Yes?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Yes, I think we're going to generate some cash
 fromsome of those initiatives, a small amount, we're going to start 
togenerate that in the first quarter, but it'll still be a 
typicalseasonal use of cash in the first quarter.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW MILLARD CASEY:</b> Okay. And then the question comes about,
 you'restarting to divest underperforming assets, you've got the ABL 
there.Could you discuss whether the current ABL restricts -- puts 
anyrestrictions on which assets or the dollar value of asset you 
couldsell?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> No, it doesn't put a restriction like that on 
it. Weneed to use that cash for debt reduction or reinvest it in 
thebusiness, but that's only restriction.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss withBMO.</p>
<p><b>JOEL GIFFORD TISS, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITALMARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH:</b>
 So just 2 questions. I wondered -- one isjust a quick clean-up if you 
can give us some idea of the revenueimpact, just to model for 2019 from 
the divestments, is it similar tothe proceeds?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> Yes, the one we called out in the press 
release ofthe mobility van business is $40 million in revenue 
approximately.The Alvarado property that Tim talked about is lower than 
that, notreally significant. So the Revability brand sales will be the 
biggestimpact.</p>
<p><b>JOEL GIFFORD TISS:</b> And then on the fire business, can -- just 
onemore question there, like are your competitors having the same 
issueswith the some of the chassis unavailability. I know your 
productionissues are probably just you guys. And I'm trying to think 
about anypotential impact on market share as we look further down the 
road?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes, we've got actually no chassis 
issue onFire because all of us in fire make our own chassis with 
theexception of obviously we do build on some commercial chassis butit's
 a small percentage of what we do. So no, I think, yes, we'regoing to be
 kind of even-up with our competitors across the board. Ithink all of us
 have some nice backlog. I think the readjustment onour labor side in 
the fourth quarter is going to -- the timing wasn'tthe best but I really
 am happy about where we put ourselves from thelabor standpoint now. And
 I think we'll be able to compete veryeffectively in the marketplace. 
All of us have been -- at least thelarge fire brass manufacturers have 
been doing fine. And we all havebig backlogs, and we're all taking a 
little bit of share from more ofthe smaller regional players here this 
year. So I think that's justgoing to continue, Joel. I think we're in 
good shape actually.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question is a follow-up question from CharlieBrady with SunTrust.</p>
<p><b>CHARLES DAMIEN BRADY:</b> Just back on the backlog, obviously, 
very highbacklog, but from a cost standpoint that flow through is on a 
prettygood lag, correct -- you're not going back and able to 
repricewhatever's in your backlog right now so the flow through on the 
costincreases I would think would be later in the fiscal year going 
intofiscal 2020 before you start realizing a lot of that or am 
Imistaken?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> No, it's mostly the second half. But
 justkeep in mind too, some contracts do have some adjustment 
provisionsin them, they're not all, locked and loaded and we're hung out
 todry. I think, we are able to affect surcharges of some of 
thosecontracts. We actually think the backlog is a pretty 
high-qualitybacklog that we have right now. We think some of the backlog
 we havewhen we got the big spikes in the second quarter that we had to 
shipout third and fourth quarter, those were not necessarily 
qualitybacklogs. And we got kind of hung out to dry with those 
reallyvicious high increases that we got in the second quarter but we're
 ingood shape now. We like the quality in our backlog, and we thinkwe'll
 be able to cover cost as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmannwith Jefferies.</p>
<p><b>STEPHEN EDWARD VOLKMANN, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 I just had a couple of quick things. Obviously, one of theproblems 
we've had this year is the market just does not likesurprises, and I 
know you're saying that 1Q will be down versus lastyear but it's a big 
range. So I guess I'm just trying to see ifthere's any further guidance,
 Dean. I mean, will you be profitable onan EPS basis in the 1Q? Or can 
you give us some kind of book-ends sowe don't just do this again in 90 
days?</p>
<p><b>DEAN J. NOLDEN:</b> I don't think we want to give quarterly 
guidance,Steve. I think last year we were at $21 million of EBITDA and 
we'regoing to be below that. I really don't want to get into 
quarterlyguidance. Tim, maybe...</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> No, I think Steve, I think the real 
issueis, it's all relative, right? You can kind of see what happened 
inQ4. Q4 is very similar to what we're looking at in Q1, and we don'tsee
 really any recovery until Q2. And the reason we feel prettyconfident 
about it in Q2 is we got the material already coming in.Unless we've got
 it in our hands, it's hard for us to really committo numbers that we 
think we've got. But we're not -- we're abouthalfway through Q1. I've 
already mentioned one of the surprises thatwe had on transit buses and 
the surprises keep coming. So it's reallyhard to give you some solid 
guidance. We just know for a fact rightnow, and we're trying to give 
everyone a heads up, it's going to bebelow last year. We know that for 
sure.</p>
<p><b>STEPHEN EDWARD VOLKMANN:</b> Okay. And Tim, the surprise you just alludedto was the windows?</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Yes, yes, and that's just one of 
theobviously several things that we deal on a daily basis. But 
oursourcing team has actually done a tremendous job, really kind 
ofexpediting a lot of things, and we're working -- it's kind of a 
toughsituation, right? We want to manage cash but we got to get 
thematerial in here. The more -- if we get the material in here 
inadvance, we feel confident that we can get the shipments out. So wegot
 opposing strategies there. But I think we're managing throughthat. I 
think we probably modeled this thing about a hundreddifferent ways, and I
 think we feel pretty confident that as we movethrough this year now and
 staying ahead of the material gain with thebacklogs we've got that we 
can get back on top of it.</p>
<p><b>STEPHEN EDWARD VOLKMANN:</b> Okay. And then I just had kind of 
abigger-picture question. It feels like you guys have had a few, Idon't 
know how to describe them, kind of adventures maybe obviously,sort of 
what you're doing in China, what you're doing in Brazil, I'mthinking of 
the coach business. Those feel sort of noncore domain,this seems like 
kind of environment where you really should be allhands focused on the 
core business and improving these things. So isthere an issue where 
either management time or attention has beensort of siphoned off on some
 of these other things. Are thereadditional activities that you could 
curtail that would help you tofocus on the core business going forward? 
I'm just trying to thinkabout how many balls you have in the air at one 
time.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> You're very observant, Steve. 
Everything'son the table. Obviously, Revability is gone because it was 
taking alot of our time to focus to try to make that profitable. That's 
aninteresting sale because it's a sale/merger. We've taken an 
equityposition in VMI. VMI is owned by private equity and this now 
createsa situation where our product line becomes part of VMI's who 
competeswith only one other player in mobility van of meaningful size 
andthat's BraunAbility, which obviously creates a very good 
competitivedynamic in the marketplace. We're out of it as far as 
producingproduct daily, but we're still in it, because we have equity 
positionin VMI, going forward. I raise that because there's a lot 
ofdifferent ways to do and deal with things. Everything's on the 
table.If we don't think it's a core business and we do think 
it'sdistracting us, it will be divested, it will be gone. And you named 
afew things that we have to take a look at as we move through 2019here. 
We want to continue to consolidate, and our core businessesstill have 
some ability -- or we have some ability to consolidatesome of our core 
businesses. So we'll be looking more towards thosethings.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have reached the end of the question-and-answer 
session.Mr. Sullivan, I would now like to turn the floor back over to 
you forclosing comments.</p>
<p><b>TIMOTHY WILLIAM SULLIVAN:</b> Well, thanks again for everyone 
joining ustoday. Obviously, tough times at REV Group, but it's 
temporary, it'sshort-term. The fact that we have the backlogs that we 
have, the factthat our markets are strong -- if you are running a 
business, amanufacturing business those things are golden. Backlog is 
awonderful thing and the fact that, that backlog is solid and it's 
--none of it's going away gives us all the opportunity in the world 
tojust progress forward, put our head down and make sure that we 
doeverything we can to execute on our plans that we have in place.Again,
 short-term issues like this are easily overcome. The mainthing though I
 do want to say and this is something that -- we'vebeen growing so fast 
in the last couple of years without a lot ofheadwinds that it's time now
 for us to really move to the next levelof management expertise and 
that's to manage cash as we move through2019. I think, obviously, it's 
part and parcel of any business thatyou run, and this gives us an 
opportunity to really make sure that wepull things together as a 
management team, we hunker down. I can tellyou that probably in the last
 3 months, this management team hasworked harder coming up with plans to
 execute when we have all theseoutside forces. We're getting very, very 
good, and we're going to bevery good as come out the backside of the 
short-term issues thatwe're dealing with right now.</p>
<p>So thanks, again, for joining us. We'll talk to you again at the 
endof first quarter, and obviously we'll have a much brighter idea or 
atleast clear picture of what fiscal 2019 will bring us. Happyholidays, 
everyone.</p>

<p>The news release with our first quarter results was issued and postedto our website earlier this morning.</p>
<p>Before we start, I'd like to remind you that certain statements 
madeduring today's conference call regarding Winnebago Industries and 
itsoperations may be considered forward-looking statements

<p>With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Presidentand CEO, Michael Happe. Mike?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, WINNEBAGOINDUSTRIES, INC.:</b>
 Thank you, Steve, and good morning to everyone ontoday's call. We are 
sincerely grateful for your time and for yourinterest in Winnebago 
Industries.</p>
<p>We will begin this morning's discussion with an overview of ourfiscal
 year 2019 first quarter results and a brief perspective on thebalance 
of the year.</p>
<p>I'll then turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, 
BryanHughes, who will provide more detail on our financial results. I 
willthen return with closing comments. And as always, we will end 
thismorning's call with a Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>As fiscal year 2019 kicked off in late August of this past summer, 
wehad just completed a successful fiscal 2018 year, a year in 
whichWinnebago Industries surpassed $2 billion of net revenues for 
thefirst time in company history. North American RV market share 
hadrisen to approximately 8.5%. And we completed the acquisition 
ofChris-Craft, one of the world's finest luxury boat brands, in 
anintentional effort to diversify to new outdoor lifestyle arenas. Itwas
 a good year.</p>
<p>We now look to 2019 in this fiscal year for more of the same: 
salesresults that surpass those of the industries we compete in; a 
focuson driving higher levels of profitability and asset utilization; 
andan appetite to grow in new ways that position Winnebago Industriesand
 its brands for sustained future success.</p>
<p>We are pleased with the results from the first quarter of this 
new2019 year. Consolidated first quarter revenues were up almost 10% 
forthe period, with top line growth being driven by the popularity ofour
 products across the Towable segment. We are pleased thatWinnebago 
Industries' overall revenues continue to grow organicallyand at a 
healthy pace, at a time when the RV industry is working tonormalize its 
overall field inventory levels in relation to a moremoderate retail 
pace.</p>
<p>In addition, we have made material progress in increasing 
ourprofitability. Consolidated gross profit margin increased 40 
basispoints in the quarter, driven by favorable business mix due 
tocontinued growth in our Towable segment and improved margins in 
ourmotorized segment.</p>
<p>Given the solid top line growth, coupled with margin expansion 
andimproved operational discipline, cash flows remain strong, growing84%
 over last year, and we were able to reduce debt by $38 millionduring 
the quarter.</p>
<p>Now turning to the segments in more detail. On the Towable 
side,revenues for the quarter were up 13% over fiscal 2018, leading 
tocontinued market share gains for both our Grand Design branded 
andWinnebago-branded RV businesses.</p>
<p>Our ability to outpace the industry in terms of unit shipment 
andretail growth is clear affirmation of the robust appeal of both 
ourTowables brands across a broad customer base.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA margins did decrease 240 basis points though in 
theTowable segment, largely reflecting the strong comparable period 
inthe year prior, an increasingly competitive market and continued 
costinput pressures.</p>
<p>Towables' backlog levels remained extremely healthy at over 
9,000units for the quarter but declined 3.9% in dollars versus the 
prioryear, reflecting unusually high backlog levels last year in Q1 
andthe benefits of the increased capacity we brought online during 
thecourse of calendar year 2018.</p>
<p>We are very comfortable that our current Towables' backlog is in 
linewith internal growth projections we have for the remainder of 
thefiscal 2019 year.</p>
<p>Overall, we continue to be exceptionally confident in the 
growingstrength of our dual-branded Towables lineup. This strategy was 
onfull display at a recent open house event where we introduced 
ourcompletely revamped Winnebago-branded SPYDER toy hauler and the 
MicroMinnie lightweight fifth wheel, which have unique appeal with 
smallertruck owners.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the Grand Design business, we launched 
aMomentum-branded toy hauler in a travel trailer format and 
introducedthe popular Solitude fifth wheel in a smaller S-Class. Since 
theunveiling of these new products, we've seen strong early 
ordermomentum and believe they will contribute to continued growth 
goingforward.</p>
<p>Moving now to the Motorized segment. We have continued to advance 
ourefforts to both strengthen our Motorized product line up and 
improveprofitability within the business.</p>
<p>While revenues were down modestly, 3.6% versus the prior year, 
webelieve the wholesale sales pace actually exceeded that of theindustry
 in the Q1 period.</p>
<p>We also continued our progress to expand gross margins as efforts 
toimplement operational improvements, manage cost input pressures andthe
 favorable mix related to a strong Class B quarter all factored toyield 
strong results.</p>
<p>As a result, adjusted EBITDA margins for the Motorized 
segmentincreased 400 basis points over the prior year. Restoring both 
salesand profitability momentum in the Motorized business on a 
consistentbasis remains a top priority for us, and we continue to 
dedicate aconsiderable amount of energy and resources to this effort.</p>
<p>Talent, products, systems and processes are all being worked on. 
Keyto this effort in the future will be continued new productdevelopment
 that improves our standing with the motorized dealer baseand produces 
stronger retail results and turns for our channelpartners.</p>
<p>Within the quarter, we successfully unveiled at the open house 
eventour new Class C Vita and Porto diesel models on the Mercedes 
Sprinterchassis as well as our new Adventurer Class A gas model. These 
areimportant steps but not the only ones that we will take in fiscalyear
 2019 to stabilize our Class A and Class C categories.</p>
<p>The Motorized backlog declined 24% in dollars from the prior year. 
3elements are to be considered in the comparison versus a year 
ago.First, fall of 2017 saw a positive but abnormally high number of 
newproducts introduced in the Motorhome business, particularly 
theproduct brands Intent, Revel and Horizon. We did not have the 
samelevel of new product orders this fall.</p>
<p>Second, rental orders into the Motorhome business this first 
quarterare a bit delayed versus a year ago due to retail channel 
decisions,but we are pleased with the incremental share progress our 
Motorizedteam is making in this channel.</p>
<p>And third, the market conditions for Motorhome shipments into 
thechannel are indeed tougher than a year ago, particularly in light 
ofstrong, competitive brand destocking behavior by many of our dealers.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are seeing the benefit of a full quarter of 
Chris-Craftmarine sales within our financials. We are pleased with 
theintegration of this brand into our portfolio of outdoor 
lifestyleproducts. The Chris-Craft team has had a tremendous summer and 
fall,especially touting the introduction of 2 new models: the 28 and 
35Launch GT boats. Both have received tremendous reviews from thedealer 
community and the boating industry trade press. Chris-Craftsales in the 
first quarter were strongly positive in shipments andretail versus the 
same period a year ago and they are performing onpace with the financial
 plan we modeled for the first full fiscalyear within Winnebago 
Industries.</p>
<p>With that overview, I will now turn the call to Bryan Hughes toreview
 our fiscal 2019 first quarter financials in more detail.Bryan?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES, VP, CFO, CAO &amp; TREASURER, WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES,INC.:</b>
 Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First quarterconsolidated 
revenues were $494 million, an increase of 10% comparedto $450 million 
for the fiscal 2018 period, driven primarily byanother strong quarter of
 strong organic growth from the Towablesegment and further enhanced by 
the acquisition of Chris-Craft.</p>
<p>Gross profit was $71 million, an increase of 13% compared to 
$63million for the fiscal 2018 period. Gross profit margin increased 
40basis points in the quarter, driven by favorable business mix due 
tocontinued growth in our Towable segment and improved margins in 
ourmotorized segment, courtesy of pricing that has been implemented 
overthe past year and also through operational improvements.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21%,reflecting
 ongoing investment in talent as we build our capabilitiesto effectively
 operate our growing portfolio of outdoor lifestylebusinesses and 
introduce best-in-class functional processes.</p>
<p>We also continue to make strategic investments to further 
ourprofitable growth and appropriately resource the 
transformationaljourney that we are on. And in the case of first 
quarter, weundertook a couple of strategic initiatives whereby we 
engagedoutside professional services firms to supplement our 
internalcapabilities, the cost of which were into the 7 figures. We 
arepleased with their progress, and we feel confident in the 
strategicmerits of each of these projects.</p>
<p>Even after including these incremental investments, first 
quarteroperating income was $33 million, an increase of 5% compared to 
$32million in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Net income was $22 million, an increase of 23%. And earnings 
perdiluted share were $0.70 per share, an increase of 23% over the 
sameperiod last year.</p>
<p>We have provided non-GAAP EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA 
performancemeasures in our press release as a comparable measure to 
clearlyillustrate our performance. The schedules accompanying the 
pressrelease show a reconciliation between net income and adjusted 
EBITDA.Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $39 million for the quarter 
comparedto $35 million last year, an increase of 9%.</p>
<p>Now turning to the individual segments and starting with the 
Towablesegment, revenues for the first quarter were $293 million, up 
13%year-over-year, driven by continued growth across the Grand Design 
RVportfolio.</p>
<p>Segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $31 million, down8%
 from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 240basis 
points, reflecting continued cost input pressures in a highlycompetitive
 market from a discounting perspective. These cost inputpressures have 
not yet been fully offset by further pricingincreases, which are 
anticipated in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>Turning now to the Motorized segment. Motorized revenues were 
$181million for the quarter, down 4% versus last year. While we 
continueto experience growth and market share gains in our Class B 
lineup,driven by the success of the Revel and Travato product line up, 
thisgrowth was more than offset by declines in our Class A and Class 
Cproducts, driven primarily by industry trends in these 2 classes 
andalso comparing against the pipeline fill we had last year on 
thelaunch of the Class A Gas Intent product.</p>
<p>Segment adjusted EBITDA was $12 million for the first quarter, up144%
 year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 400 basispoints, 
primarily driven by the success of the Class B products,operational 
improvements in both Northern Iowa and West Coastfacilities as well as 
cost input pressures being mitigated by fiscal2018 price increases.</p>
<p>Turning to our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, 
thecompany had outstanding debt of $253 million, comprised of 
$260million of debt, net of debt issuance cost of $7 million. 
Workingcapital was $144 million. Our current net debt to adjusted 
EBITDAratio was 1.4x, which is once again within our targeted 
leverageratio range of 0.9 to 1.5x.</p>
<p>Cash flow from operations was $54 million for the quarter, up 
$25million from last year, driven by strong growth in net income 
andfavorable changes in our working capital.</p>
<p>The combined strength of our balance sheet and cash flow provides 
ustremendous flexibility as we continue to invest in the business 
andexecute our strategic transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%compared
 to 32.3% for the same period in fiscal 2018. The favorabledecrease in 
rate of 900 basis points is driven by the impact of theTax Cuts and Jobs
 Act.</p>
<p>Finally, our board of directors approved the quarterly cash 
dividendof $0.11 per share, payable on January 23, 2019, to 
commonstockholders of record at the close of business on January 9, 
2019.This increases Winnebago's annualized dividend rate to $0.44 
pershare and represents an increase of 10% over the previous 
annualdividend of $0.40 per share.</p>
<p>We believe this to be a meaningful increase that demonstrates 
ourconfidence in both current results and future growth opportunities.</p>
<p>That concludes my review of our quarterly financials. And with that,I
 will now turn the call back to Mike to provide some closingcomments. 
Mike?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Thanks, Bryan. As we have stated several 
times thismorning, we are pleased with the positive start to our fiscal 
year2019. Our teams are working extremely hard to ensure that we 
deliverhigh quality, fast-turning, profitable products in a 
responsiblemanner to our channel partners.</p>
<p>Our RV and marine dealers trust our company's commitment to 
buildingreliable and durable products, as demonstrated by our low and 
stablewarranty rates and our industry-leading legacy of aftermarket 
partsand service support. This focus on quality, service and 
innovationcontinues to resonate as a differentiator within our markets.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that these are dynamic times within 
ourbusiness, internally and externally. First, some comments on 
ourcontinued internal transformation. In January of 2019, it will 
havebeen 3 years since I had the privilege to join this 
storiedorganization and contribute to our journey from good to great.</p>
<p>In short order, we, as a complete Winnebago Industries team, 
havecreated an energizing vision around becoming a trusted 
outdoorlifestyle solutions leader, strengthened our core RV 
business,initiated a more diversified portfolio of revenue streams, 
madepositive progress on cultural and operational improvement 
initiativesand delivered consistently stronger financial results, which 
reflecta healthy and more resilient company.</p>
<p>We highly value the assets that are our people, our brands and 
ourstrategic external partnerships. We remain committed to reaching 
thelong-range goals laid out in our November 2017 Investor 
Daypresentation, even as some of the market headwinds that are 
blowingmake a few of those goals a little bit more difficult. 
Regardless, wewill tack against the winds to find a net positive path to
 achievingour potential and delivering value to our shareholders.</p>
<p>We now have a more diversified business platform to grow from 
thanever before with active RV, marine and specialty vehicle 
operations.From an opportunity standpoint, we have significant share 
expansionpotential in each of those global markets in the next 5 to 10 
years.And we remain on the search for premium companies with strong 
brandsthat deliver on the product and service promises they make.</p>
<p>Many of you are understandably wondering about our view on the 
stateof the overall economy, the North American RV industry and 
itsprospects in the next year or 2 and the potential impact of those 
2subjects on our business. I will address each of those now. It istruly a
 more noisy and mixed macroeconomic environment. There remain,however, 
still many positive signs about further sustained economicgrowth. Fuel 
and oil prices remain extremely reasonable, which is astrong positive 
for our businesses. Consumer confidence, whilesettling a bit, remains 
actually quite stable in amidst of gloomyheadlines.</p>
<p>Inventory and retail finance companies are rational and are 
notabnormally constraining credit availability nor offering 
riskyfinancing packages to dealers or end customers.</p>
<p>Our customers appear to still be spending money on holiday 
presents,enjoying experiences at restaurants with their families and 
friendsand investing their valuable discretionary time in the 
outdoors,creating and collecting outdoor experiences. However, we 
alsorecognize that there are legitimate macroeconomic headwinds. 
Theimpact of tariffs and material cost increases are real for 
mostdurable good businesses and have resulted in higher prices at 
retailon RVs and boats year-over-year. The recent increases of the 
federalfunds rate have gained incredible attention and slightly impacted
 themonthly cost of financing for many end customers.</p>
<p>The volatility of the equities market and the slowing, 
howevertemporary, of the growing wealth effect in the U.S. have made 
someconsumers more cautious in general about near-term 
discretionarypurchases.</p>
<p>And we are still dealing with the uncertainty of the past 
midtermelection results in the U.S. and our country's ability to 
createconstructive compromise and policy both domestically and 
globallygoing forward.</p>
<p>Net-net, we still have hope in the ability of the North 
Americaneconomies to drive positive GDP growth in the next 12 months, 
butrecognize that this macroeconomic environment is much choppier thanin
 the past several years.</p>
<p>While sentiment in the broader RV market has been somewhat 
skittishlately, we remain optimistic about the long-term retail 
prospects forthe RV industry.</p>
<p>In the short term, concerns about elevated levels of dealerinventories appear to be lessening with each passing month.</p>
<p>We have been very clear in our previous statements that the 
dealerinventories of Winnebago Industries' respective RV segments 
haveremained in the comfort zones of turns, dollars and aging units 
thatwe monitor carefully.</p>
<p>Have we been impacted a bit by the overstocking of other RV brands 
atdealerships? Yes, but our teams have been appropriately working 
withmany of those dealers to ensure that we are a good partner 
anddeliver high-quality products when the dealers are ready.</p>
<p>We are also aware of the RV Industry Association's latest 
wholesaleshipment forecast for calendar year 2019 and think 
theirupside/downside range is reasonable. The real question is where 
theindustry retail number will stabilize in the spring of 2019. 
Flatretail for the whole of the calendar year 2019 is a good 
aspirationaltarget for the industry, but we also admit that due to the 
volatilityof the external environment, there could be a margin of error 
that iseither slightly positive to low single-digit negative.</p>
<p>A reminder that on a trailing 3, 6 and 12-month basis, 
WinnebagoIndustries' consolidated RV retail has been running 15 to 20 
pointshigher than the industry results. It will be a challenge to 
sustainthat spread into the future, but we are confident we will 
continue toperform at an accretive retail pace versus the industry pace.</p>
<p>What is important for our shareholders to know is that we atWinnebago
 Industries are extremely focused internally on managingwhat we can 
control: that is, our production rates and our highlyvariable cost 
structure.</p>
<p>We also won't forgo the opportunity or even obligation to 
smartlyinvest or pursue what we deem to be strongly strategic, 
long-termgrowth opportunities, but we will manage the core organic 
businessesvery intentionally and carefully during these uncertain times.</p>
<p>We are not projecting an RV industry shipment regression in 
calendaryear 2019 that comes anywhere close to the historical RV 
downturnaverages over the past 40 or 50 years. In fact, as our Q1 sales 
andresults demonstrated, we at Winnebago are still focused on 
drivingaccretive growth to the industry in sales and EPS for as long 
asmarket conditions allow.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the balance of fiscal year 2019, WinnebagoIndustries
 is in good shape to continue outpacing the RV and Marineindustry in 
terms of top line sales at both the wholesale and retaillevels and drive
 improving profit performance from a yieldstandpoint.</p>
<p>We think our track record of doing what we said we will do in thelast
 3 years has improved significantly, and we are committed to be ahigh 
quality, well-managed company that investors can place theirtrust in.</p>
<p>With that, I'll wrap up our comments for this morning. We would 
liketo end by thanking all of our Winnebago Industries' employees 
fortheir hard work during the quarter and for their continued 
dedicationto providing our customers with high-quality products and 
services.And we wish all of our employees, channel partners, 
strategicexternal partners and all of you on the call a happy holidays 
and asafe holiday season.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your time today. I will now turn the line 
backover to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from CraigKennison with Baird.</p>
<p><b>CRAIG R. KENNISON, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH OPERATIONS AND 
SENIORRESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, 
RESEARCHDIVISION:</b> I wanted to start, Bryan, with a question for you.
 Ibelieve you mentioned discounting in the -- in your prepared 
remarks.It's my impression that Grand Design does not offer discounts. 
Couldyou just clarify those remarks for us?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, that's right, Craig. The discounting 
that wesaw in the quarter was more focused on the Winnebago-branded 
Towablesbusiness. Grand Design by virtue of the strength of that brand, 
thestrength of their momentum, does not find themselves in the 
samesituation as our evolving Winnebago-branded business. And so 
thosecomments were more directed or entirely directed to 
ourWinnebago-branded Towables business.</p>
<p><b>CRAIG R. KENNISON:</b> Thanks. And another detail question on the 
rentalmarket. I understand that it impacted results here. Could you help
 usunderstand the impact it had on units at the wholesale and 
retaillevel during the quarter? And whether you expect to get all of 
thatback in future periods?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes. Our current discussions with the 
rentalcompanies are still evolving, Craig. We feel that they're going 
inthe right direction or a positive direction just from an overallmarket
 share standpoint, but we did have a timing difference in termsof orders
 taken in Q1 this year versus where we were at last year. Socan't 
quantify it specifically or choosing not to just forcompetitive reasons 
obviously. But we feel like we're heading in theright direction there.</p>
<p><b>CRAIG R. KENNISON:</b> Thanks. And then, Mike, finally, I had a 
questionon capital allocation. I believe there is $66 million remaining 
onthe share repurchase authorization, so if my math works, you couldtake
 that to 0 and still be below 2x on a debt-to-EBITDA ratio.What's the 
board's thinking around the balance sheet and the abilityto retire 
shares relative to other investment options you may have? Imean, the 
stock really hasn't been this cheap in a while.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. Good morning, Craig. Thanks for the 
question,and I'll offer the opportunity to Bryan to weigh in here 
toopotentially after my comments. The board has -- we are in 
constantdiscussions with the board and specifically the finance 
committeethat we created within the board structure a couple of years 
ago nowto discuss all of our capital allocation options. And as we 
firstshared at our Investor Day in the fall of 2017 -- and we've 
stayedpretty disciplined to both the priority but also sort of 
leverageratio range in terms of our balance sheet and thinking about how
 weallocate capital.</p>
<p>And we certainly have placed a priority on organic and/or 
inorganicgrowth strategies first and certainly are also mindful of the 
debtrepayments of the existing debt we have on the balance sheet 
asanother priority, always maintaining an eye on liquidity for 
thecompany, especially in volatile times. And that's probably a 
morerelevant topic here, given some of the increasing volatility of 
theRV industry.</p>
<p>Certainly, other decisions in terms of the use of capital 
likedividend payments to our shareholders and repurchasing stock 
areconstantly weighed and assessed by Bryan and his corporate financeand
 treasury team. And we are in good discussions with our boardabout how 
many dollars to allocate to each of those investments. Yes,the stock 
price is low. In fact, in our opinion, it continues to beextremely low 
versus our performance and that does weigh into thediscussion we have 
around capital location on share repurchaseoptions. But there are other 
elements that factor into where weultimately put our dollars. And so, 
Bryan, I don't know if you wouldadd to that at all?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> No, I think that covers it. The only -- the 
prioritythat we laid out was specifically growth, 
deleverage/liquidity,return cash to shareholders. We conveyed our 
prioritization as such.And so in the most recent quarter, our initial 
target was, again, tofocus on the growth to continue to provide the 
expansion that wecommitted to on the Towables businesses and the 
investments thatwe've made there. But then also to deleverage back into 
our targetedrange of 0.9x to 1.5x, which as I stated in my prepared 
remarks, weaccomplished in the quarter. So I would just supplement 
Mike'scomments with that.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Scott Stember with CL King.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT LEWIS STEMBER, SENIOR VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, CL KING&amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 Maybe talk about -- I knowthe backlog is down year-over-year, but 
obviously you guys had a bitmore capacity to this year. But if you flush
 out the backlog and youlook at the incoming orders, it looks like there
 was a nice jump overthe fourth quarter, at least from a sequential 
standpoint. So I thinkit's clear that the orders are there. Can you 
maybe just talk abouthow that sets you up for the next I guess couple of
 quarters headinginto the spring selling season from a growth 
perspective?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, 
let mestart with Towables first. That's probably a more directly 
correlatedanswer in the sense that we do remain pleased with our 
Towablebacklog. And as I said in my prepared statements, we stand today 
orat least at the end of the quarter at a little bit over 9,000 
grossunits there. And that is in line with the amount of back orders 
thatwe think at the end of Q1 is a good base as we begin Q2 and go 
intothe rest of the year. And as you noted, we constantly have 
incomingorders from our dealers being generated by the respective 
Towablesbusinesses.</p>
<p>And I do think we had a positive reception to the new products, 
asmentioned in our script as well for both the Winnebago-branded andthe 
Grand Design brand at the September RV open house event inElkhart, and 
that certainly helped a little bit. But I can't put muchmore color on it
 than we're comfortable with our Towables backlogboth in light of our 
own I guess future growth projections internallybut especially in light 
of the industry.</p>
<p>And we've long maintained that backlogs in the RV industry are 
notalways the best indicator of future performance because there may 
beother dimensions to why the back orders are the way they are. 
Thatwould ultimately have an impact on whether you have positive 
ornegative shipment growth in the future.</p>
<p>But our Towables business backlogs we feel good about today. 
TheMotorized backlogs are a little bit more of a mixed story. As 
Bryantalked about, there are some timing on the order side related to 
someof our rental business. We feel especially strong with the Class 
Bside and even our Class C backorder log has hung there in a bit. 
Eventhough, if you look at our Q1 shipment performance there, you 
would-- you might not guess that. Class A is where the majority of 
ourbacklog number for the motorized segment regressed. And a good 
chunkof that is the absence of some of the new product orders that we 
tooka year ago at the RV open house in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>And so the RV -- the motorized business continues to be one in 
whichwe're making, we believe, net positive progress. But it is at 
timesnot as consistent across the categories as we would like to see. So
 Iapologize for the rambling answer there, but Towables backlogs, wefeel
 good about. Motorized backlogs, we feel good in Class B. Alittle bit 
better in Class C. Class A we have some work to do.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT LEWIS STEMBER:</b> All right. And regards to the Motorized 
side,very, very nice improvement in profitability there. Maybe just 
thoughwalk us through, again, where you would expect ultimately the 
EBITDAlevels in this segment to come out? I know that the last few 
quartersor going back a little bit more than that was a little more 
difficultgiven the lack of knowing where things were going to turn out 
butclearly things are coming back here. Maybe just talk about where 
youthink this could go?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. I'll offer a comment, and Bryan, 
please, weighin as necessary. Yes, we are pleased with the Motorhome 
profitabilityrecovery in this quarter year-over-year versus Q1 of fiscal
 '18. Tobe a bit fair, we probably dipped lower in Q1 of F '18 than we 
shouldhave. But it is good to see the Motorhome margins continue 
tosequentially improve but also more importantly kind of 
improveyear-over-year.</p>
<p>We do believe there's more runway there. I'm going to be a little 
bit-- I'm going to hedge that comment just a bit for a couple ofreasons.
 One is, the material cost environment continues to be a[resister] of 
sorts to all of our RV businesses. You saw somepressure on the Towable 
side this quarter, particularly input costthat we just could not 
timing-wise either drive out of the businessor price out of the 
business. Motorized though has done a nice job.</p>
<p>We believe that this Motorized business should operate at a 
grossprofit level in the low teens and someday potentially in 
themid-teens. Now that would be extremely high from a historical 
RVstandpoint to be in the mid-teens gross profitability-wise with 
theMotorized business, but that is our aspiration. The challenge is 
withthe material cost environment and with the difficult 
shipmentenvironment that we're now facing within the RV industry as 
dealershave tightened up on their inventory and when and how they 
takeproducts. There will be some pressure points on motorized 
margingoing forward. But we are pleased with where we're at today. 
We'dlike to stay at that level and grow in the future. That may be 
aquarter-by-quarter story. But I think there's still more runway forus 
to be more efficient, come out with new products that generateinnovation
 and higher margin levels. And that will be our objectiveover the next 
couple of years to keep improving.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT LEWIS STEMBER:</b> Great. And just last question, Bryan. You
 talkedabout on the operating cost side some cost for some outside 
folksthat came in helping you with some of your initiatives. Maybe 
justtalk about that, a little more granular, and how long these 
potentialcosts could stay on the books? And that's all I have.</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes. As you know Scott, and as we've talked 
about inthe past, we're on a transformation journey. And so from time 
totime, we're going to get some external help in that journey 
andsupplement our internal resources accordingly. I'm not going 
toprovide a lot of granularity to it for competitive reasons as you 
canappreciate. But these are -- our projects we did incur in Q1, 
theremight be a little bit of tail as we head into Q2 here. But they 
wererather isolated as a Q1 initiative.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Seth Woolf with NorthcoastResearch.</p>
<p><b>SETH WOOLF, VP &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, NORTHCOAST RESEARCH PARTNERS,LLC:</b>
 So just thinking about some of the comments you made, Mike, withrespect
 to retail, I think you said that flat retail in 2019 is goingto be -- 
is a good aspirational target and there could be a littlebit of 
downside. So the two questions I have with respect to thatcomment are, 
number one, at what point in the year, once we -- youstart the winter 
shows, will you feel comfortable saying, hey, it'sgoing better than 
expected or it's -- maybe flat is too aspirational.When do you think you
 might have a sense for when we'll have a betterread on retail in 2019? 
And then secondarily, if there is a littlebit of margin for error and it
 comes in weaker than expected, what doyou think a reasonable floor 
would be on retail declines next year?And then if at that floor, how 
should we think about Winnebago andGrand Design's ability to outperform 
the rest of the market?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. Good morning, Seth. Thanks for the 
questions.First, retail timing. I'm sure other OEM leaders have their 
ownopinions on timing. We're in a -- we talked about, especially with 
alot of our investors lately, that this has been an industry certainlyin
 transition from double-digit retail growth to single-digit 
retailgrowth. And now in some of the recent months in which SSI 
hasreported, at least its initial monthly retail results, you've seenthe
 retail results dipped to the negative side now for severalstraight 
months stand-alone.</p>
<p>We have still, we believe, some pretty tough comparisons from a 
yearago on shipments and retail for the industry to comp 
against,probably between now and I would argue probably March, Sep of 
thespring. I think the December, January, February and even March 
SSIretail numbers will be very interesting for us to all see.</p>
<p>And by then, as you know, we'll have the ability to go throughseveral
 regional retail shows plus many of the dealers and their ownopen houses
 on their lots. And then we have the new RV IndustryAssociation, RVX 
event, I believe in the 2nd week of March in SaltLake. So I would say 
timing-wise, we should have a good read on sortof the market stabilizing
 around the new normal retail rate sometimein that March time period. I 
think it could be difficult for us toproduce positive comp numbers on 
shipments in retail as an industrybefore then. But I will state, back to
 your latter question, thatWinnebago Industries and our brands, we 
believe that we have theability for at least the time being to continue 
outperforming theoverall industry.</p>
<p>And as we've shown in some of our investor decks, our 3-month,6-month
 and 12-month trailing retail performance has run anywherebetween 15 to 
20 points higher than the industry retail performance,and a lot of that 
is certainly driven by the momentum that we have onthe Towable segment.</p>
<p>So it may be hard, Seth, for us to kind of maintain that 
retailperformance gap at 15 to 20 points up, maybe that falls to 10 
pointsup or 15, we'll see, but I think we can still continue to 
outperform.</p>
<p>And so last question or one of the questions you asked was is there 
afloor to our own retail thoughts? I just hesitate to answer thatbecause
 it would be purely a guess at this point. In my comments, Icertainly 
did state that flat for calendar year 2019 would not be theworst result.
 But depending on some of the other factors that areweighing on 
consumers' minds, it could go up a point or 2 and itmight go down more 
than that, into the low single-digit negative. Andso we'll have to see. 
As you all know, there'll be some news out ofthe Federal Reserve today 
on their interest rate decision, and it'salmost a week-to-week 
conversation in terms of business performancethese days.</p>
<p><b>SETH WOOLF:</b> Okay. Is it -- if it drops next year, and if it 
dropsmore, is it fair to think that it makes it harder for you guys 
tocontinue to outperform? I guess, that's what I was getting at.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> No, I think we can continue to, especially 
in ourTowables businesses, have above industry average performance for 
sometime into the future, if we continue to be focused on making 
greatproduct, working with our dealer partners in a trusting, caring 
wayand providing great service to the channel and to our end customers.I
 think if we stick to our game plan, we have the ability to continueto 
take share in the Towables market.</p>
<p>And on the Motorized side, it's more about finding 
consistentperformance going forward. Month to month, we sometimes on 
theMotorized side now see a shipment or a retail share increase, but 
thenext month it could be given away. And so we're looking 
forconsistency from our Motorized team now across their categories, 
notjust in Class B where we've had a really good success, but 
acrosstheir categories. So that is a little bit more inconsistent. But 
Ibelieve we can continue to outperform the industry for the timebeing. 
How far the industry would potentially retreat woulddefinitely have an 
impact on how accretive our growth or EPS could beto previous year 
results. But we're not ready to get into that today.We're more focused 
on Q2 now and executing our playbook.</p>
<p><b>SETH WOOLF:</b> Understood. I appreciate it. I guess, really 
quickly,Bryan, just thinking about the margins, excellent quarter out of
 theMotorhome business, and it's been a while. So I guess, a lot of 
thisseems to be operational improvements. You guys talked about 
thedifferent moving parts that are kind of working for and against 
theMotorhome business going forward. As we go throughout the rest of 
theyear, should we continue to think of this as a 5.5%, 6.5% 
EBITDAbusiness, even given the environment that we're in from a 
shipmentperspective? And then on the Towable side, great share gains, 
but itlooks like incremental margins were negative. How should we 
thinkabout that going forward? And then you alluded to more 
priceincreases, it's an environment where dealers are destocking. I 
mean,what kind of work have you done to make sure that it doesn't have 
anoverly adverse impact on retail sales, because I think that would 
beprobably a headwind stuff there.</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, for sure. So I'll start with Motorhome, 
Seth,and Mike already talked quite a bit about the 
Motorhomeprofitability, so I don't want to spend too much time on it, on
 topof what his earlier comments were. I will tell you though that 
theMotorhome team did a really good job with pricing. There was a 
fewprice increases that were done during our fiscal 2018 that 
areobviously benefiting the margin equation sitting here today. We 
hadfavorable mix from the Class B performance, so those things 
aresustainable. I think we'll continue to see good results from ourClass
 B business. We had, as Mike alluded to, a low point in Q1 oflast year 
where we had talked about the investments we were making inForest City 
and new lines and bringing the Intent and the Outlook upon a new line 
and the productivity took a hit in Q1 of last year.We're through that 
now, so that's sustainable. And likewise, the WestCoast challenges that 
we talked a lot about, from Q1 of last year, wethink have largely been 
addressed thanks to the excellent work by theteam out there, they've 
done a phenomenal job of getting thatbusiness operating at a much better
 level. So all those things pointto sustainability, Seth, with where 
we're at right now. So we'regoing to continue to see cost pressures. 
We'll see what happens withlist 3 here that was scheduled to go in on 
January. And I thinkeverybody is wondering the timing, is it a go? Is it
 a no go? So Ihedge my comments only knowing that there is continued 
uncertainty asto the direction that the administration will take that 
and thepressures it will create.</p>
<p>So I guess those are the supplementary comments I make 
aboutMotorhome. Turning to the Towables business, I already talked 
inresponse to Craig's question on discounting that we executed in 
theWinnebago-branded Towables business. That was certainly a headwind 
tomargins in the quarter and a necessary reaction to the pressures 
thatthey're facing in the market considering the positioning of 
theirproduct relative to market. And the fact that it's still an 
evolvingbrand that we're working hard to mature and make more prominent.
 Butnonetheless, we're subject to the pressures of the industry right 
nowand it's certainly the case in the Winnebago-branded 
Towablesbusiness.</p>
<p>The strength of the Grand Design portfolio is obviously continuingand
 we think that we will be in the position of taking more pricingto 
offset the material cost inflation. That's what I was referring toin my 
earlier comments and that those price increases will be rolledout. We 
feel like we have the positioning within the Grand Designportfolio to do
 that. And so I expect that margins will see someimprovement as we 
execute on those pricing decisions.</p>
<p>And as we -- ideally in the Winnebago-branded Towables business arein
 a better position to discount less going forward as well. So I'doffer 
those comments, Seth.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Steve O'Hara with Sidoti &amp;Company.</p>
<p>STEPHEN MICHAEL O'HARA, RESEARCH ANALYST, SIDOTI &amp; COMPANY, 
LLC:Just curious on the, I guess, on the improvement within the 
marginson Motorized side. Can you just talk about how much of it was 
drivenby kind of product mix? You shipped a lot less Class As in 
thequarter, and I think that's where the core issues have been 
onMotorized side. Can you just talk about how that impacted the 
quarterand maybe if the Class A had been flat and some of the others 
havebeen down more, maybe how that would have impacted the margins? 
Iguess I'm just wondering where we are on the Class A improvementmargin 
side?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, I think Class B and the strength of 
Class B inparticular was a favorable mix. But that said, if we had, had a
 lotmore of a Class A and Class C strength, I don't want to convey 
that,that would have diluted margins and that it was a huge mix issue. 
Ithink it was largely a pricing aggressiveness that offset thematerial 
cost increases and then addressing the operational, whatI'll call 
operational inefficiencies that we saw during the firsthalf of last 
year. So it's primarily that, that drove theimprovements in the margins.</p>
<p>STEPHEN MICHAEL O'HARA: Okay. And then just on the margins versus 
theTowable side, it seemed like -- I thought the comment was that 
thecommodity cost pressures impacted the Towable side more so than 
theMotorized side, and I'm just wondering why that would be the case.Are
 you behind in kind of passing those price increases on versus 
theMotorized, or are they kind of on par with each other?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, fair question. The Motorized business, 
recall,is more vertically integrated that creates some of that 
difference orat least creates difference in the timing of when those 
costs mightbe incurred. But it also is an internal hedge against the 
increases.Towables business is more exposed to pricing increases that 
arepassed directly to them from the vendors. So I think that, that isone
 of the differences. And then I will also say that the Motorizedpricing 
timing was weighted more towards the early. The Towablesbusiness has 
been more gradual in the recovery of the pricing. So Ithink those 2 
things are really what I would call out as some of thedifferences in 
between the Motorized margins and the Towablesmargins.</p>
<p>STEPHEN MICHAEL O'HARA: Okay. And then maybe just lastly on CapEx. 
Idon't think I heard it, but where do you see that playing out for 
theyear? I mean, it seems like -- based on your commentary 
aboutaspirational retail, I mean, would you expect CapEx to be down 
thisyear? And then maybe what's reasonable run rate in kind of a 
flatenvironment generally? I mean, obviously, that's not 
typicallyavailable but just curious what that might be.</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, we're going to take a cautionary 
approach toCapEx in our investments there given the environment that 
we're in.We'll have investments that we have committed to in the form of
 theexpansion projects for the Towables businesses and the completion 
ofthose obviously. And we think that those are still prudentinvestments 
to make even in the environment that we're in. But Ithink a reasonable 
rate to use this year for now would be in the $35million to maybe $40 
million. But like I said, Mike and I will bekeeping a very close eye on 
the environment that we're in and pullingback or even accelerating those
 investments as we think prudent.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMOCapital Markets.</p>
<p><b>GERRICK LUKE JOHNSON, SENIOR TOYS AND LEISURE ANALYST, BMO CAPITALMARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH:</b>
 The inventory on your book, sub-25%, can youdiscuss that a little bit? 
I'm sure there's some Chris-Craft andhigher input cost. But maybe if you
 could break down the componentsof the inventory increase and how you 
feel about it?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> And that increase that you're citing is versus theyear-end?</p>
<p><b>GERRICK LUKE JOHNSON:</b> Year-over-year.</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Year-over-year, Q1-to-Q1. Yes, I think that 
there'sa couple of things going on. We've got increases in our 
chassisinventory that we have taken on for strategic reasons, that's 
onething driving it. We certainly have higher finished goods on our 
lotjust by virtue of the industry dynamics that we're in. And so those 
2things are going out. So some of it's industry driven and some of itis 
indeed just timing.</p>
<p>Another factor, as the industry slows down, you've got purchases 
thatare coming in the door that you're continuing to adjust downward 
andso you have got some timing that you deal with on inventory in 
thatregard, too, and that would be what I'm referring to, there is 
rawinventory. So primarily an inventory thing and some AR as well. 
Andthat just gets to some of the timing of orders when they 
happenyear-over-year but nothing systemic that I think you should assume
 inyour models that, that would be resolved in other words I 
wouldanticipate in Q2.</p>
<p><b>GERRICK LUKE JOHNSON:</b> Okay. And then in Motorized, you're 
basicallyable to double Class B capacity. How are you able to do that? 
And howare you allocating production and capacity across Motorized?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. Our Class B production, Gerrick, is run
 out ofa couple of facilities in North Iowa, and we're very pleased with
 themanufacturing and the operations team ability to continue to allow 
usto grow shipments and share in Class B within our 
existinginfrastructure. And so it is a lot of hard work in terms of 
beingable to reflow the operations within -- particularly the 
biggestClass B plant and increase throughput, reduce tech time with 
nosacrifice, certainly we hope on product quality and reliability 
oncethose products are built.</p>
<p>It's funny that you've raised the topic in this way, I've 
recentlyasked our team, some of the what-if questions about the 
potential wehave in Class B and how and if this category continues to 
grow in thefuture, what our plans are in the very long term to continue 
to keepup with our potential. So it's a very active ongoing topic right 
nowwith our Motorhome manufacturing team. And we believe in North Iowawe
 have plenty of capacity in terms of space and also labor to beable to 
find ways to continue to grow Class B. But the team is doinga great job,
 and they worked very hard to keep up with our potentialin that market, 
and we have every intention of making the investmentsnecessary to not 
let our manufacturing side be a constraint on ourClass B growth in the 
future.</p>
<p><b>GERRICK LUKE JOHNSON:</b> Okay. Just quickly a follow-up, you 
brought itup so I'll ask the question about it. You mentioned warranty 
andthat's been an issue for Thor. How is your warranty expense 
affectingyour margins in this quarter as compared to last year?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes, our warranty expenses over really the 
pastnumber of quarters has been quite stable. I would 
probablycharacterize them as flat. I'd have to go look at each of 
theindividual businesses but on a consolidated basis they're 
probablyrunning about flat. And we always want to be careful here of 
beingoverconfident because we've had quality issues here and 
therecertainly in our past. But we view that as one of the 
differentiatorswithin our business model. And our teams at Grand Design,
 atWinnebago Towables and at Winnebago Motorhomes are -- and 
inChris-Craft are focused on superior product quality versus 
thecompetition every day. And our employees do their best to try 
todeliver that to our dealers. And I think a high majority of the timewe
 do, and when we fall down, we take care of the problems, own up tothem 
and resolve those in a hopefully expedient way. But yes, it hasnot been a
 major deterrent. I wouldn't tell you that warranty ratesare getting 
materially better, per se, they're just pretty stable.But stable in this
 industry right now is a good thing, and thedealers do give us credit, 
especially on the RV side for us workinghard to try to deliver products 
to them that show up and have beeninspected and are in good shape and 
are ready for retail sale withminimal dealer work on their lot. So it's 
definitely a part of ourrecipe for success going forward.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Michael Swartz with SunTrust.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL ARLINGTON SWARTZ, SENIOR ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY,INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 Real quick one for me. I think everythingthat I wanted to ask has been 
asked. But as people were kind ofbandying about the possibility that, 
that retail continues to slow ordecline in 2019, maybe you can just 
frame I guess your cost structurefor us and then maybe relative to 5, 10
 years ago. I know you guysweren't here at this time. But I mean, in 
terms of variable versusfixed cost structure, how does the business look
 today? How did itlook maybe going into or during the last recession?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Well, Michael, good morning. I'll offer a 
commentfirst, Bryan, and then ask you to follow on. I would say from a 
macrostandpoint, in some ways, we've always had a highly variable 
coststructure. And the great work that was done 5 or 10 years ago 
byleaders at Winnebago Industries before those of us on the call 
gothere, I think they were always focused on having a highly 
variablecost structure. I would contend that what's different today is 
-- andI'll let Bryan speak to that cost structure specifically, 
what'sdifferent today is 2 things. One, our portfolio mix is different. 
Andso we have a less vertically integrated component of our business 
inTowables, which is growing, whose gross profit margin tends to 
runhigher than Motorized, but it has less innate vertical 
integrationinfrastructure around it.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are very focused today on operational 
efficiencies,productivity, even things like employee safety, which 
improve theculture, workplace retention, can even lower [cost at times.]
 But ourteams are becoming more effective at driving waste out of 
theorganization where they see it. And we're not as formal from a 
leanstandpoint as we'd like to be someday, but we're getting better 
everyquarter with identifying projects. And so I would say our 
flexibilityin addition to variability of our cost structure has also 
improvedhere over the last 3 to 5 years. Bryan, any other thoughts 
there?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> Yes, I think you mentioned, the portfolio is 
verydifferent today than it was during the last recession. But that 
said,at a high level, if you look at our cost structure as a percent 
ofsales, it really hasn't changed that much, and we continue to 
analyzethat. And we work hard to retain that variable nature so we can 
reactgiven we're in a cyclical industry. But I think I said this at 
theinvestor meeting last year that we were about an 80% to 85%,depending
 on the business you're looking at, 80% to 85% variable coststructure, 
and that is consistent with where we are today, and it'sconsistent with 
where we were when we were singularly motorizedcompany. So we have 
retained that flexibility to react in any kind ofdownturn.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from David Whiston withMorningStar.</p>
<p><b>DAVID WHISTON, STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 If adownturn did hit sooner than later, are you guys comfortable with 
thebalance sheet's debt levels where they are now? Or do you think 
youwould be caught flat-footed a bit?</p>
<p><b>BRYAN L. HUGHES:</b> We take great pride in managing that closely 
andalways understanding where we're heading and what kind of 
downturnscould come. And so no, I don't think we're flat-footed at all. 
Infact, we're well prepared to sustain a downturn, and we will 
managevery aggressively, should a downturn start to affect our 
performancein a more meaningful way.</p>
<p>Right now, as we just disclosed, we've got great growth and good 
cashflow and it continues to allow us to pay down debt. So we're 
feelingconfidence sitting here today of our position on the balance 
sheet.</p>
<p><b>DAVID WHISTON:</b> Okay. And on discounting, is that -- what 
you've seenrecently, was that pressure really all on the Winnebago 
Towable side?Or is it also on the Motorized side? And then second part 
to thatquestion would be, you talked earlier about how the Winnebago 
Towablebrand is a relatively young brand in towables. So how do you 
balanceprotecting the brand, which Mike I know you've talked about 
manytimes is so important versus staying competitive in that market 
whenyou're trying to differentiate yourself from these 
establishedplayers in towables.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. I'll 
speakfirst to the breadth of the discounting. The answer is yes, 
ourWinnebago-branded RV businesses, both Motorized and Towables are 
moresusceptible to the pressures of industry-wide discounting, 
especiallydiscounts offered by OEMs to dealers to take product into 
thechannel. Those have a more competitive direct impact on the 
2Winnebago businesses, largely because the business model still has 
alegacy of negotiating on a more individual basis with the dealersthat 
carry our products. That is something we certainly are doingeverything 
we can over time to try to get away from. A great creditand kudos to the
 Grand Design team, who when they started theirbusiness 6 years ago took
 a very fundamentally, philosophically, purestance on how they would 
take orders from dealers, how they wouldprice orders and starting with a
 white piece of paper, they werereally able to come out of the gate with
 a business model that,again, to their credit, to our credit now, we 
remain committed to.</p>
<p>The Winnebago side RV business is one where we hope to evolve to 
aplace where we're less impacted by competitive discounting in orderto 
reach our sales and profit goals. But that's a journey. Specificto 
Winnebago Towables, it is a relatively young Towables business. Webought
 that business in late 2010 from a company called SunnyBrook.And while 
we're pleased inordinately with the progress that has beenmade, 
especially in the last 2 years, we admit very publicly that wehave much 
more work to do to mature in that business.</p>
<p>The product line has been very centered around travel 
trailers,especially lightweight travel trailers. And Scott and his team 
havedone a great job there taking share in the spaces they compete, 
butwe have no presence of significance today in stick and tin. We haveno
 presence of significance in sort of mid- and high-profile fifthwheels. 
And our toy hauler line is just now being reintroduced withthe 
introduction of the recent SPYDER.</p>
<p>So Bryan and I both had the opportunity this week to be on 
theWinnebago Towables campus and to walk the new buildings that we 
areopening up for both assembly and lamination there that will allowthat
 business to continue to grow, but will also be the home to someof these
 new products we're introducing.</p>
<p>So as the Winnebago Towables business strengthens its product line,as
 we continue to create a stronger team and culture there, and as 
wecontinue to earn trust with more A and B dealers in the RV 
industry,that business should not only be able to perform better but 
should beable to protect against variability in its financial 
performance in amore consistent way. So a great question, definitely a 
work inprogress, but one as you know we're strategically committed to 
sothat people can get into the Winnebago brand at a more affordableplace
 than they otherwise could if we were only a Winnebago 
Motorhomebusiness.</p>
<p><b>DAVID WHISTON:</b> Just one more question that's on rental. 
Readingbetween the lines today, it sounds like perhaps rental is not 
goingto be as good as it was last year. And if it did come in a 
lotsofter, how much is that going to mess you up meeting your fiscal 
'19projections?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Well, I would be careful on "not going to be
 asgood." I think there's a -- we have a little bit of a timingsituation
 here with some of the rental business. As Bryan mentioned,we're having 
good discussions with a number of our rental partners.I'm actually 
confident that we may have a path to come out with a netpositive market 
share increase on the rental business, specific toMotorized in our 
fiscal 2019 year, and I won't get into details ofhow much and to whom, 
but I do believe where the industry slowdown ishaving an impact on the 
rental side is the turning of the fleet thatthese rental companies go 
through.</p>
<p>As you know, they buy units from the OEMs, they use them for a 
periodof time as rental units, and then they dispose of them either 
sellingthem direct to end customers or in many cases trying to find 
otherindependent dealers to take that rental inventory and then 
thosedealers will sell it. As the industry has slowed a bit, and 
obviouslyall dealers are more acutely managing their inventories, I 
think thatfleet turn on the rental side is probably slowing a bit.</p>
<p>And again, the rental market is a meaningful but not a huge percentof
 the Motorized business. So for us, it's been more of a timing aswe've 
been working with each of these rental companies on, how manyunits do 
you want? When do you want to take them? But in some cases,we're getting
 more from rental companies than we have before, and inother cases maybe
 we're getting a little less. We think it'll be anet positive gain from 
our Motorized team this year.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.</p>
<p><b>FREDERICK CHARLES WIGHTMAN, ASSISTANT VP &amp; ANALYST, CITIGROUPINC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Justone quick one. I think 
earlier you had mentioned that dealerinventories were improving 
month-over-month. I'm wondering if youcould just expand on that a bit. I
 think in the past you've talkedabout 20% to 25% of dealers having a bit
 more inventory than you'dlike. So how is that sort of trending today 
and where do you sort ofsee the inventory levels going forward?</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J. HAPPE:</b> Well, I think they're getting better 
sequentially.We aren't always at -- we don't always have the industry 
fieldinventory information on our fingertips, but I was pleased to see 
thecomments from Thor Industries in their last earnings call about 
theirfield inventories year-over-year being in more positive ranges 
thanpreviously. And so obviously with Thor being such a large part of 
theRV market, that's probably as good a barometer as we all have 
asanything.</p>
<p>But we talk to the -- especially the inventory finance 
companiesregularly. And again, consistent in some ways to previous 
calls,there's no panic going on there about the aging. Turns have 
certainlyslowed a bit as retail has slowed. But dealers are being very 
prudentin their restocking behavior. And I don't have a probably 
apercentage I would offer this time as to which dealers are 
stillover-inventory. I think it certainly continues to decrease. What 
welike on our side is we're also seeing a sequential improvement in 
ourfield inventory levels from the prior 2 quarters. And even as we 
sithere today, 3 or 4 weeks into our second quarter, our field 
inventorylevel today is less than it was percentage growth-wise than it 
was atthe end of Q1.</p>
<p>So we continue to go the right direction there as well, althoughwe've
 always maintained that our field inventory levels areappropriate even 
with an increase based on our market share growth,our new products and 
the way we're trying to increase the quality andquantity of our dealer 
network on the Winnebago side.</p>
<p>So again, I think every month it gets better. I think next springwill
 be very important to kind of see dealers come out of the winterand how 
optimistic or not they are about retail prospects going intothe spring 
selling season based on shows, open houses, other things.So I think 
we'll have a really good look at that as I mentioned toSeth and the -- 
probably the February-March time period.</p>

<p>STEVEN LITT, 4010 CAPITAL, LLC: Yes, hi, my question was answered.Thanks.</p>

 Thanks, Susie, and congratulations on your new role asTreasurer and 
Vice President of Investor Relations, couldn't behappier for you.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as 
wediscuss our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which 
weissued just yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe fiscal 2018 has already come to an end. When 
webegan the year, we had just closed on our GCA acquisition, opening 
anew chapter in ABM's future. What followed was a monumental year forus 
on several fronts. In addition to adding more than 30,000 new 
teammembers from GCA, we also faced one of the toughest labor markets 
inAmerican history and the acute impact of Brexit on our U.K. 
retailbusiness, all while keeping our clients happy and team 
membersengaged. At no point during the year were we deterred from 
achievingour goals of accelerating organic growth through new 
sales,integrating GCA successfully, protecting margins and driving 
freecash flow generation. I'm so proud of the team's ability to 
navigatethe challenging macroeconomic environment while delivering 
againstour short-term plans and progressing towards our long-term goals.</p>
<p>To summarize our performance for the year, we concluded 2018 
withrecord revenues of more than $6.4 billion, driven by 4% 
organicgrowth. Our GAAP continuing EPS was $1.45 per share or $1.89 
pershare on an adjusted basis and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.1%for
 the year. We also generated a record level of free cash flow atmore 
than $200 million. These results are consistent with what weoutlined in 
the second half of the fiscal year, and I'm pleased thatoverall, the 
team's delivered on their commitments.</p>
<p>Let me dive into some of the drivers of these results. And let 
mestart by saying, I was really pleased with our organic growth infiscal
 2018. All year, we've been discussing our determination toaccelerate by
 adopting a sales culture and supporting this initiativeby investing in 
sales resources and revamping how we train, manageand measure our teams.
 Even in this tight labor market, wesuccessfully attracted new sales 
people to the company and incollaboration with our operations team, we 
achieved our stretchtarget of approximately $900 million in new sales, 
demonstrating howour investments are bearing fruit.</p>
<p>Our strategic key accounts continued to expand with us as 
well,particularly in Business &amp; Industry and Technology 
&amp;Manufacturing. Even in our more customer-concentrated portfolios 
likeAviation, we expanded in our core service lines and by entering 
newbusiness lines. We recently announced our multiyear contract 
withJetBlue for catering and logistics, a service line that was 
nascentjust earlier this year and is now targeted for growth with our 
otherAviation clients.</p>
<p>As we enter fiscal 2019, we're excited about our sales momentum 
andour pipeline. We're dedicating our efforts to retaining our 
customerbase through our account planning process and ensuring that we 
aremaking the right long-term decisions for the business.</p>
<p>It'll probably be helpful to do a 1-year look back at GCA, since 
thatwas so foundational for our 2018 results. The acquisition 
increasedour scale and scope by adding more than $1 billion in revenue 
to ouroverall portfolio this year, in line with our expectations. 
Duringour first year of integration, we combined our sales and 
operationsteams and aligned the business with our procurement and 
marketingstandards while managing all back-office support function. 
Thisintegration was no small feat, considering we operated on 2 
separateERP systems. Furthermore, we overdrove synergies during the 
year,exceeding our original projections by ending 2018 with 
approximately$18 million in realized savings. We remain on pace for run 
ratesynergies at the higher end of our original $20 million to 
$30million range. These synergies, in addition to several costmitigation
 strategies, enabled us to maintain our margin outlook for2018, even 
given the continued labor pressures.</p>
<p>On that note, let's discuss what has become one of the most 
highlypublicized topics this year. ABM is one of the nation's top 
employerswith a labor force of more than 130,000 skilled and nonskilled 
teammembers. This puts us in the unique position of understanding 
andseeing the effects of the labor markets. Once the level 
ofunemployment and underemployment in the U.S. economy began to dip 
tohistoric lows, we were among the first companies to discuss 
itspotential impact. Towards the end of the second quarter, we began 
tosee a heightened decrease in both the availability and quality of 
thelabor force. It was particularly acute for us in industries 
withstricter application processes such as Education and Aviation as 
wellas certain geographic markets. At that time, we projected a total 
60basis points of incremental labor and labor-related pressures to 
ourmargins. Since then, we have not seen the labor environment 
improvebut we also haven't seen it worsen materially either. 
Whilechallenges remain, we've been getting ahead of some of the 
pressuresthrough proactive dialogues with clients and tighter 
expensemanagement.</p>
<p>I mentioned that our U.K. business saw challenges from the impact 
ofBrexit. The London retail economy has been particularly pressured 
andthat is where we had our biggest concentration of Technical 
Solutionswork. While we messaged these challenges throughout the year, 
we'reclearly disappointed by our results. Despite this specific issue, 
ouroverall U.K. portfolio benefited from a full year of our Transportfor
 London win, which is one of the largest organic contracts in ABMhistory
 as well as expanding services with key Aviation clients.</p>
<p>From an enterprise perspective, we continue to make progress 
intransforming our back-office operations. It's hard to believe 
ourHouston-based shared services center began the fiscal year 
overcomingthe challenges from Hurricane Harvey and are now fully 
functional andbeginning to see the benefits of operational consistency. 
This hasled to quantifiable results with our cash flow, which is an 
importantmetric for our organization and a key indicator of our 
strongfundamentals. It has enabled us to deleverage faster 
thananticipated, and in 2019, we expect to see a continuation of 
strongcash flow.</p>
<p>2019 will be one of the most important years on our path tofulfilling
 our 2020 Vision transformation. We will be implementing anumber of 
technology-based modernization efforts that will make usmore efficient 
operationally and enable our goal of ultimately beinga more data-driven 
company. In the first half of the year, we'll havea new HRIS system that
 will give us the ability to manage our humanresources and learning and 
development function more strategically,as well as reduce the cost of 
employee acquisition over time. Also,manual administrative processes 
will be automated, which will reduceoverhead as we progress.</p>
<p>We have already begun the implementation of e-pay, our newcloud-based
 time and attendance system for our field operations,which will improve 
scheduling and facilitate daily labor reviews,ultimately creating 
efficiencies for ABM as well as our clients. Andfinally, later this 
fiscal year, we will have a new unified financialsystem, combining our 2
 legacy ERP systems. The migration to astate-of-the-art ERP system will 
equip our team with data andanalytics to drive our business. Just based 
on the technologyinitiatives alone, 2019 will set the stage for 
financial benefits in2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>And progress is not only happening in our back-office and 
withtechnology, but we're also improving all aspects of our 
organizationall the way up to the board room. Recently, we welcomed to 
our Boardof Directors LeighAnne Baker, the Chief Human Resources Officer
 forglobal food and agriculture company, Cargill Incorporated. Cargill 
isone Of the largest companies in the country and employs more 
than150,000 people, so clearly, you can see how LeighAnne's 
experienceand guidance will be invaluable to us as we move forward.</p>
<p>2019 will mark ABM's 110th year in business, which is a 
tremendousmilestone. We are the leader in the industries and markets in 
whichwe serve and have grown to become the country's 44th 
largestemployer, which means we have the scale to support our 
remarkableclients. So as much as the current condition in the labor 
marketshave become a short-term headwind, the incredible breadth of 
our130,000-person team will be our greatest long-term tailwind 
andcompetitive advantage. We are a durable and resilient business with 
ahighly diversified model that can manage in a variety of 
differenteconomic cycles. Our 2020 Vision transformation has pushed 
every eraof our company, and we're stronger than we've ever been. 
Theinvestments we are making will enable us to continue to 
differentiateour offering in the market and position ABM for the next 
110 years.</p>
<p>Now let me turn it over to Anthony.</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, ABM INDUSTRIESINCORPORATED:</b> Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.</p>
<p>Before I review our results, please keep in mind the resultspresented
 in this release reflect our acquisition of GCA, whichclosed on 
September 1, 2017. Therefore, the financial results andassociated 
year-over-year comparisons discussed today reflect 12 and2 months of GCA
 operations for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017respectively, which include 
the related revenue and profitcontributions as well as higher 
amortization, interest expense andshare count. For fiscal 2017, the 
fourth quarter and full yearresults also reflect the transaction's 
acquisition cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, our fiscal 2018 results for the quarter and yearreflect the benefit of the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.</p>
<p>Now on to our results for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Total revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10.1% versuslast
 year, driven by incremental GCA revenues of $88 million and 4.2%organic
 growth within the Business &amp; Industry, TechnicalSolutions and 
Technology &amp; Manufacturing segments.</p>
<p>On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was 
$8.9million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to a loss of $2.5 
millionor $0.04 last year. This quarter's results reflect a 
noncashimpairment charge of $26.5 million, which resulted from our 
revisedoutlook of our Technical Solutions business in the U.K, which I 
willdiscuss in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for 
thequarter increased 65% to $38.8 million or $0.58 per diluted 
sharecompared to last year.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 
$90million at a margin rate of 5.5% compared to $70.8 million at a 
rateof 4.7% last year.</p>
<p>I'll now turn to our segment results, which are described on Slide 
12of today's presentation. As we've noted all year, our 2018 
operatingsegment results reflect a remapping of overhead expenses 
related toGCA, including allocations and additional amortization. 
Therefore,year-over-year comparisons will not be meaningful until 2019.</p>
<p>Our B&amp;I segment grew 7.8%, achieving revenues of $737 
million,driven by $14.5 million of incremental revenue related to 
GCA.Organically, B&amp;I finished the year strong with organic revenue 
up5.7%, which primarily reflects our TfL win in the U.K. We have 
nowanniversaried the TfL contract, and as a result, its 
incrementalcontribution to organic growth will decrease over the next 
fewquarters. Management reimbursement revenue also increased by morethan
 $6 million. Operating profit for the quarter was $43.6 millionfor a 
margin of 5.9%, reflecting approximately $2 million ofamortization 
related to GCA. Excluding GCA-related amortization, theoperating margin 
for total B&amp;I was 6.2% this quarter. For thefull year, B&amp;I 
delivered operating margins of 5.3% or 5.6%excluding amortization 
compared to our low 5% expectation. B&amp;Istable performance all year 
has been the cornerstone of our businessand demonstrates the strength of
 our diversified model.</p>
<p>Aviation reported revenues of $265 million. During the quarter, 
wecontinued to expand into strategic service lines across majorairlines,
 which offset certain contract losses we previouslydiscussed. Operating 
profit for the quarter was $2.6 million. Duringthe quarter, startup 
costs associated with our catering and logisticsservice line was beyond 
our original projections, which impacted thequarter by 90 basis points. 
These costs have now normalized and ouroperating margin should begin to 
trend back in line with our originalprojections. Operating margins also 
reflect the acute impact that thecurrent labor environment continues to 
have on the Aviation segment.For the full year, Aviation ended with an 
operating margin of 2.3%with a minimal impact from amortization compared
 to our high 2%expectation.</p>
<p>Technology &amp; Manufacturing revenues increased to $234 million 
forthe quarter, up 15% versus last year. This was driven by 
incrementalGCA-related revenue of $19 million and organic growth of 
5.9%. Wegrew through a combination of new wins and expansions at our top
 HighTech clients. Operating profit was $17.5 million for a margin rate 
of7.5%. Excluding $2.7 million of GCA-related amortization, 
operatingmargins were 8.7% for the quarter. For the full year, 
operatingmargins were 7.3% or 8.4% excluding amortization. Overall, we 
arepleased with the results we have seen in the T&amp;M segment, as 
theyperformed in line with our expectation of low 7% operating 
marginsduring this first year as a newly integrated group.</p>
<p>Revenue in Education was $214 million, reflecting approximately 
$50million of incremental GCA business. Operating profit for the 
quarterwas $12 million or 5.6% in margin. Excluding $6.8 million 
ofamortization, operating margin was 8.8% for the quarter. Similar toour
 Aviation segment, our Education team has been particularlychallenged 
with the current labor markets. Operating margins for thefull year were 
5.2% or 8.3% excluding amortization. The Educationssegment delivered 
full year results that were in line with ouroperating margin expectation
 of high 4%. In addition, Educationbenefited from a onetime inventory 
adjustment during the quarter as aresult of our standard year-end review
 procedures. Looking ahead, weare encouraged by the momentum of our 
Education team and the salespipeline we continue to develop where we are
 seeing opportunities tocross-sell other services within the portfolio.</p>
<p>Healthcare revenue was $67 million for the quarter, including 
$2million from GCA. Operating profit was $0.9 million, which 
includes$0.2 million of GCA amortization.</p>
<p>Finally, Technical Solutions reported revenues of $131 million, 
ayear-over-year increase of 15% for the quarter. The TechnicalSolutions 
segment has been a tale of two cities all year. Ourdomestic business has
 been thriving with increases in BES revenue andcore project work for 
the quarter and year. Fourth quarter resultsalso reflect beneficial 
timing of certain projects that were executedlater in the quarter. On 
the other hand, our U.K. business has beenunderperforming as a result of
 the uncertain economic conditionsprecipitated by Brexit and its impact 
at certain sectors of theeconomy. As we've shared on previous calls, we 
have been monitoringthis business acutely. Given the expected continued 
challenges inthis market as well as a customer deflection, we impaired 
goodwilland intangibles associated with this segment in the amount of 
$26.5million during the quarter. This noncash charge is excluded from 
ouroverall adjusted results but reflected in our segment 
results.Excluding this charge, operating profit for the quarter would've
 been$18.1 million or a 13.8% in margin, leading to normalized 
operatingmargins of 9.2% for the full year, in line with our 9% margin 
target.</p>
<p>Turning to cash and liquidity. Cash flow from operations 
wasapproximately $93 million for Q4. The combination of our new scale 
ofGCA as well as the foundational improvements we've made through 
ourenterprise shared service center helped drive sustainable 
workingcapital management improvement throughout the year. We also 
benefitedfrom certain strategic actions we took during the year such as 
themidyear termination of our swap as well as onetime tax and 
insurancecollateral refunds. Even excluding these onetime benefits, 
wegenerated more than $210 million of free cash flow for the year,above 
our recent projection for $175 million to $200 million. In2019, we 
anticipate consistent performance and to further strengthenour healthy 
balance sheet.</p>
<p>We ended the quarter with total debt including standby letters 
ofcredit of $1.1 billion and a bank-adjusted leverage ratio of 3.2x. Iam
 pleased with our accelerated pace of deleveraging.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we also paid a quarterly cash dividend of 
$0.175per common share for a total distribution of $11.5 million 
tostockholders. And I am pleased to report that our board has 
approvedour annual dividend increase to $0.18 per share, marking our 
211thconsecutive quarterly cash dividend. As Scott said, 2019 will be 
our110th birthday, and we are so proud to have raised our dividend 
formore than 50 consecutive years as part of our history.</p>
<p>Now for a quick recap of our annual results.</p>
<p>Overall revenues increased by 18% or $988.6 million compared to 
lastyear. The increase in revenues was attributable to $858 million 
ofincremental revenues predominantly from the GCA acquisition andorganic
 growth of approximately 4%.</p>
<p>Our GAAP income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was $95.9million or $1.45 per diluted share.</p>
<p>On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the yearwas $125.3 million or $1.89 per diluted share.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the year grew to $326.4 million, and we ended 
thefiscal year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.1% versus 4.3% 
lastyear.</p>
<p>Now turning to our guidance outlook.</p>
<p>We are introducing a fiscal 2019 GAAP guidance outlook range of 
$1.65to $1.80 and on an adjusted basis, $1.90 to $2.05 per share.</p>
<p>Next year will be the second full year that we operate under 
ourcurrent business segments following the acquisition of GCA.Therefore,
 quarterly results will be comparable on a year-over-yearbasis. However,
 given our extensive discussions regarding variousinitiatives as well as
 the overarching labor headwinds we've beenfacing, I want to provide 
additional details to contextualize thecadence of the year.</p>
<p>Our revenue growth in fiscal '19 will be predicated on bothcontinuing
 our new sales and the expansion momentum we saw in fiscal'18 as well as
 retaining accounts that are up for renewal. Withretention, our focus is
 with the right customers and contracts with apath to quality long-term 
business. So overall in fiscal '19, weexpect our top line to be in the 
range of our historical results andon a comparative basis, we expect to 
see some front-end and back-endnormalization, as large contracts like 
the TfL anniversary and ournew sales begin to comp out.</p>
<p>Turning to margins, we are forecasting adjusted EBITDA margin in 
therange of 5.1% to 5.3%, which reflects a full year headwind of 
labor,which we saw escalating at the end of the first half of fiscal 
2018,offset by proactive price escalations, labor-management processes 
weare and have been implementing as well as the full year impact 
ofsynergies associated with GCA. Keep in mind, any improvement would 
bepartially offset by the continuation of investments we are making 
inour IT infrastructure to create and optimize our scalable platforms.</p>
<p>Given 2019 will be our first full fiscal year under the Tax Cuts 
andJob Act, I want to discuss some of the reasons why we expect 
ouroverall tax rate to increase 30% compared to fiscal 2018. Ourexpected
 2019 tax rate of 30% excludes discrete tax items such as theWork 
Opportunity Tax Credit and the tax impact of stock-basedcompensation 
awards, which we currently expect to be approximately$7.5 million for 
2019. This compares to $11 million in fiscal 2018.Additionally, while we
 will continue to benefit from a full year oflower overall federal tax 
rates, there are a number of items that didnot impact us in fiscal 2018.
 These include limitations or deductionsrelated to meals and 
entertainment and executive compensation plussome foreign tax 
provisions. The culmination of all these items willhave an approximately
 200 basis point increase in our effective taxrate year-over-year.</p>
<p>We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 to be between 
$50million to $60 million, and we expect depreciation of $50 million 
to$55 million. These ranges reflect our continuing investments in IT 
aswell as growth CapEx.</p>
<p>When considering our quarterly EPS cadence for fiscal 2019 on 
anadjusted basis, we expect a proportion of earnings between the 
firsthalf and second half of the year to largely mimic what we saw 
infiscal 2018.</p>
<p>I also want to discuss some changes that will be implemented infiscal 2019.</p>
<p>As stated in our earnings release, we have adopted the new 
revenuerecognition standard also known as ASC 606. The guidance we 
aregiving today does not reflect any accounting impact that may arisedue
 to timing from ASC 606, which could be in the range of plus orminus 
$0.05. The main drivers that could cause some variabilityinclude:</p>
<p>Sales commission cost, which will now be deferred and recognized 
overthe expected customer relationship ranging from 1 to 8 
years.Previously, commission costs were expensed as incurred.</p>
<p>Profit margin on uninstalled materials associated with our 
TechnicalSolutions project-related contracts are deferred until 
installationis substantially complete. Previously, margin on uninstalled
 materialwas recognized upon delivery under the percentage of 
completionmethod.</p>
<p>Initial fees from sales of franchise license will now be deferred 
andrecognized over the terms of the initial franchise agreement, 
rangingfrom 1 to 3 years. Previously, initial fees from sale of 
franchiselicense were recognized upon the completion of the sale.</p>
<p>We'll provide clarity on these items as results are reported and wenavigate the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Finally, in fiscal 2019, we intend to expand our disclosures 
byproviding intersegment revenue as well as revenue by service lines.</p>
<p>With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from theline of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp;CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I wanted to dig into, I guess,factors driving the top line here in 
fiscal '19. I guess maybestarting with, I think, Scott, you had a 
stretch goal of $900million, you hit that, but it sounds like you guys 
talked out somemoderation in the organic growth rate year-over-year. I 
guess itsounds to me like maybe the missing hole there is retention 
rate. Canyou talk about, maybe, about some of the dynamics that you're 
lookingat and you also had -- are annualizing the contracting TfL, But 
canyou just talk about some of the dynamics that you're seeing in 
termsof top line in general but maybe retention specifically, maybe 
it'sfalling out of the discussions you're having on the 
price-costdynamics from labor?</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> Sure. That is great, Andy, and that's right 
on. Wefeel like we're going to be able to replicate if not overachieve 
whatwe did this year in new sales. So all's well on the top line 
forexpanding with our customers and cross-selling and bringing in 
newbusiness. I think for us, this is the year of having a keen focus 
onretention, right? Because we have had some pricing pressures as weknow
 because of the wage rates and the current labor market, but Ithink this
 is the time where we're going to dig in and make somestrategic 
decisions about accounts that aren't performing to ourexpectation level,
 and as we look -- we don't think there'll be adramatic difference in 
retention rates, we're talking about togglinga point or so, but I do 
think it's something that's going to haveadded pressure, especially as 
we have mid-cycle conversations withclients where we're not performing.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Yes. I guess that makes sense. I mean 
have --just in terms of visibility you have into that point or so 
thatyou're identifying here, I mean have those accounts that need to 
havethose tougher conversations already been engaged and identified 
thatgives you confidence in that point? Or do you feel like you 
stillneed to work through your overall portfolio to develop 
someconfidence as '19 proceeds?</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> Yes. As we planned 2019, we looked at 
everyaccount. We developed account plans. So we feel like we've 
identifiedthe accounts where we're having more challenges. And we're 
going tobe strategic about it too, right? Because if it's a 
large-scaleclient that we have the opportunity to continue to expand 
with andmove through the cycle, it will be a very different decisions 
mapthan a client maybe that has just one asset and is more 
price-focusedthan really buying into our platform. And that's the way 
we'rethinking about it, and just to give you some idea of how 
we'rethinking about it, when we planned our escalations for 2019, 
we'vebudgeted into our guidance about 25% increase year-over-year. So 
--that's not necessarily a number you put in your model but you 
shouldjust understand directionally that we feel that we're going to 
havesome good success but it just -- there is some risk with that.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Got it. Okay. The other thing I heard in
 theprepared remarks and I thought was kind of interesting, was 
thenumber of IT systems that you're putting in: HR, e-pay and 
thencombining your financial systems. I think in '18 you also had 
somesystems implementations. I guess -- I have no doubt that 
they'rebaked into guidance, Anthony, but most of these systems are SaaS 
typeof things that do get expensed and pressure the P&amp;L. Just so 
wecan get a sense of what this margin guidance, you gave us here 
today,really represents, can you talk about what the cumulative headwind
 tomargins is from all of these systems implementations?</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Sure, Andy. And you're exactly right,
 ourstrategy over the last, call it, 1.5 years has been to move more 
ofour infrastructure and software to the cloud. So over time, youshould 
see a reduction in the CapEx associated with the IT systemsand then the 
corresponding increase in our OpEx. And then we'reexpecting obviously 
efficiencies from these new systems on the laborside as well as from the
 back-office perspective. From a total costyear-over-year, we're 
anticipating the increase in IT spend to beapproximately $10 million on a
 year-over-year basis, and that will beprimarily reflected in our 
corporate segment.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> And you know what, Andy, if you think about 
2020Vision and the cadence of the transformation, the part one was 
tochange our operating model and be more solution provider, 
right,bringing more of our services to bear for our clients. And then 
parttwo of it was working through our shared service center, right, 
ourprocurement, all the things that we've talked about. This is thestage
 now where we are investing in the platform to enable a lot ofthe best 
practices that we outlined through our 2020 Vision program.So it's 
really exciting because in our minds, the ABM of 2020 isgoing to be a 
more data-driven, analytic company as a result of allthese investments 
and that's just going to help us drive our businessand ultimately 
accelerate in the future. So this is, kind of, rightin line with where 
we want to be.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Yes. No doubt this is that vision. I 
guessAnthony, given that some of these are not implemented. I guess 
therewere some that you did say are in effect today, but some are 
comingin over the course of the year. If it's $10 million cost for 
thisyear, what's the annualized run rate because presumably, there's 
somecarryover that's going to get lapped into 2020 that we want to 
beaware of as well.</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Yes. I think the way to look at it, 
Andy, isthe cost increase year-over-year going to be primarily the 
result ofthe SaaS model as well as the beginning depreciation of the 
CapExassociated with putting in place these systems. On a 
go-forwardbasis, we're not anticipating incremental so the run rate from
 anoperating expense should be in line with what we forecast or 
whatwe're anticipating fiscal '19 to be, the biggest difference is 
goingto be the switch between depreciation and OpEx over time 
becomingmuch more an OpEx -- both of our systems, although they're 
deployingthroughout fiscal '19 from a software-as-a-license 
perspective,they're expensed -- they're fully expensed in '19, so we're 
not goingto see a lot of year-over-year going into '20.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Got it. Okay, and then just -- I'm going
 tofinish up here at this -- at least for this go around on tax rate. 
Sojust you went through a lot there pretty quickly but you guys givethis
 guidance of 30%, but obviously, the number that's going to be onthe 
income statement is going to be a little less because WOTC is thebig 
one. And I think you said it's going to down like what $7.5million from,
 was it, $11 million last year? Is that right, Anthony?</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Yes. The way to look at it is really 
in 2components. Our discretes are primarily going to be WOTC and FAS 
123Rand then we have 179B, which are associated with our 
energy-efficientprojects, which is the one that we frankly don't have 
very goodvisibility because it's project dependent. So when you look at 
WOTCand 123R, we had roughly $11 million in fiscal '18. 
We'reanticipating $7.5 million in fiscal '19. The WOTC should 
berelatively consistent, the biggest driver is going to be the drop 
in123R, and that's really a function of the share price as well as 
theexercise option value, when these options were -- options 
orstock-based comps were put in place.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> Okay. So then the 30% really turns intosomething closer to what, 25% or 26%?</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW JOHN WITTMANN:</b> And then you would also get the benefit 
of the-- or the deductibility of stock compensation, which would lower 
thetax rate a little bit further and that would get you to your 
adjustedEPS, right? I just wanted to make sure that for people listening
 intothe call that this is all very clear, the tax rate that 
they'reactually going to see is not 30%, it's going to be something 
closerto 25%, maybe...</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Yes. The way to look at it, the 30% 
isreflective of the full year of the U.S. Tax Cut Act, but it 
hasincremental increases for provisions that didn't impact us in '18. 
Sofrom a year-over-year basis, purely from the tax rate, we would havean
 increase, which is not intuitive, and I think I've been signalingthat 
since Q3 of last year around making sure our investorsunderstand that 
tax is just comparable, are going to go upyear-over-year and then 
exactly to your point, what offset that willbe the benefits from these 
discretes.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from theline of Marc Riddick with Sidoti.</p>
<p><b>MARC FRYE RIDDICK, BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SERVICES ANALYST, SIDOTI&amp; COMPANY, LLC:</b>
 Wanted to touch a little bit on the CapEx guideand wondering if you 
could parse out for us, what -- how much of thatwould be considered, 
sort of, the growth CapEx, if you will and whatwill be maintenance CapEx
 for '19? And how we should think about howthat might evolve beyond '19?</p>
<p><b>DIEGO ANTHONY SCAGLIONE:</b> Sure. So CapEx in general should be 
roughlyabout 1% of our sales. That's the way we look at it internally 
andthen the split of that is going to be -- $45 million to $50 millionof
 that is going to be kind of the maintenance CapEx, and that willbe for 
equipments. Historically, that would be for systemsimplementation as 
well as our software when we would host it. As youlook forward, I would 
bake in 1% as being the right run rate. It'sharder -- it's hard for me 
to say that number should materiallydifferent from what we've 
historically seen given the growth in thebusiness and some of the CapEx 
associated with that growth.</p>
<p><b>MARC FRYE RIDDICK:</b> Okay. Great. And then I wanted to be shift 
over toa little bit of -- if we can sort of get some thoughts and 
updatesaround the pricing discipline and go-to-market strategy benefits?
 Andhow -- what differences that you're seeing by segment a little 
bitbecause, I mean, certainly, there's quite a bit going on and then, 
ofcourse, you're going to be layering on the technology changes, but 
Idid want to get a sense of maybe the receptivity that you're seeingand 
the differentiation by -- from one segment to another that mightbe 
helpful?</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> So look, I think the pricing impact on the 
businessis universal. It's not in any particular industry group. This is
 asituation that's facing each of our segments and really facing eachof 
our clients as well. And I think that's what has gotten us in agood 
place because you have these quarterly conversations withclients. So 
it's not the first time they're hearing about it, andthey're facing the 
same challenges. So that's why we think there isgoing to be more 
receptivity this year on escalations as we goforward and why we felt 
comfortable budgeting higher. And as I saidearlier, there is no question
 that there's a risk with that and we'llbe more discerning, but it's 
nice to have something impact you that-- this is one way misery loves 
company, because you have a narrativethat everyone can share in, and 
that's why we're getting thereception that we're getting.</p>
<p><b>MARC FRYE RIDDICK:</b> Okay. Great. And then one of the things I 
wasthinking about, as far as the -- as you go through the year with 
thetechnology enhancements throughout the year, I was wondering if 
youcould touch a little bit on where you feel you are on the 
analyticside I suppose? And if you feel as though you have that 
capabilityin-house as take advantage of what you'll be deriving during 
thecourse of the year from your technology improvements? Or whether 
weshould see an update in some of the analytic needs within thecompany?</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> So it's early on, right? We're in the point 
nowwhere we're just starting to deploy all of this technology. So Ithink
 from a pure analytics and data from these systems, it's reallygoing to 
be a 2020 story because that's when we'll start to be ableto talk about 
year-over-year changes. However, we still have theinfrastructure like 
for example, one of the things that we're veryfocused on is managing 
daily labor, right? So it's a manual processright now when it's getting 
done. So when we enable the technology,it's going to just make us more 
efficient, and it's going to free usup to do some of the other things 
we'd probably like to be doing. Butthe reality is we're still focusing 
on all the key things we have todo in this labor environment. It's the 
technology that's going toenable us. So it's an evolving story. These 
systems are all startingto come online throughout the year but in terms 
of having true dataanalytics, that's not going to be more manually 
derived, that'sreally something that we're going to feel comfortable in 
2020.</p>
<p><b>MARC FRYE RIDDICK:</b> Okay, that makes sense. And then one last 
thingfor me, I was wondering if you could give maybe some thoughts as 
tosome of the things that you've learned initially as to the 
strategicservice line enhancements within Aviation and then maybe some 
of thethings that you've learned from there is that something that 
youcould see in -- taking into others segment as far as expandingservice
 line opportunities?</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> The main thing we learned is that 
clientsappreciate when we come to them with solutions, right? 
We'vehistorically been a single service company, and we are just 
startingon this path, right? But by now, as our teams are getting adept 
attalking about cross-selling, like this year was our bestcross-selling 
year ever. We did close to $100 million incross-selling services. And 
we've seen it happen in unique places, inour Education line, we're 
expanding with healthcare, so a lot of theuniversities will also have 
hospitals as well. So it's something thatwe can talk to with clients now
 and -- but this is still -- it's along-term process to get our people 
skilled at cross-selling but tothink that we did close to $100 million 
this year, we were prettyencouraged by that, but we still feel like we 
have a lot more runway.So being a solution provider, it is going to 
prove out as part of ourlong-term thesis. And you enable that with 
technology and the accountplans and standard operating practices, and we
 just think we have awinning combination in the future.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> At this time, I'll turn the floor back to management forany final comments.</p>
<p><b>SCOTT B. SALMIRS:</b> I just want to thank everybody for following
 us andparticipating throughout the year and just wish everybody a happy
 andhealthy holiday season and a prosperous 2019. We look forward 
toupdating you at the end of Q1. Thanks, everybody.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing
 by. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being 
recorded.</p>
<p> Now I would like to turn the conference over to Christina Cheng, Senior Director of Investor Relation. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
<p> CHRISTINA S. CHENG, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF IR, DSW INC.: Thank you. Good
 morning, and welcome to DSW's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. 
Earlier today, we issued a press release comparing results of operations
 for the 13-week period ending November 3, 2018, and October 28, 2017. 
Comparable sales are calculated for the same 13-week period ending 
November 3, 2018, and November 4, 2017.</p>
<p> Please note that remarks made about the future expectations, plans 
and prospects of the company constitute forward-looking statements. 
Results may differ materially due to various factors listed in today's 
press release and our public filings with the SEC, and we assume no 
obligation to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
<p> Joining us today are Roger Rawlins, Chief Executive Officer; and Jared Poff, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p> Now let me turn the call over to Roger.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, DSW INC.: Thanks, Christina, 
and good morning. For 2 years, we've been articulating our vision to 
position DSW Inc. for strong earnings growth, and today, I'm pleased to 
report our team's result. Our strong momentum has continued as we 
delivered a 7% comp and 56% earnings per share growth this quarter, 
following our 10% comp and 66% earnings per share growth in the second 
quarter. On a 12-month rolling basis, we've driven a 5% comp, operating 
income growth of 35% and earnings per share growth of 56%. Gross profit 
and operating margins are leveraging, demonstrating the strength and 
discipline we have in our core business.</p>
<p> As I compare our results for the retail landscape, I'm excited to 
see DSW Inc. at the top of the list, both from a comp sales and 
profitability increase standpoint. Fiscal 2018 will be one of the best 
earnings growth years in our history. I am confident that with the 
investments we made, the strategies we laid out, our team will continue 
to sustain our strong momentum.</p>
<p> We've also completed 2 major acquisitions in the last 12 months 
while delivering the outstanding performance in our core businesses. 
This would not have been possible without the leadership talent upgrades
 we have made across the business over the last 3 years. As these 
leaders focus on running the business, this has allowed me and a few 
other key executives to pursue new growth opportunities. As a leadership
 team, we are clear on our responsibilities and nothing will distract us
 from delivering on our mission to inspire self-expression.</p>
<p> The strategies we have laid out to drive the business are the force 
behind our third quarter and year-to-date result. The $833 million of 
revenue this quarter and the quarterly increase of $122 million are both
 company records, driven by substantial comp growth in our core U.S. 
Retail segment. Additionally, the Canadian Retail segment had an 
outstanding quarter and drove significant earnings into the business in 
just the second quarter since the acquisition was completed.</p>
<p> At our U.S. Retail segment, every category, women's, men's, athletic
 and accessories, had positive comps in Q3. We're committed to fueling 
this incredible momentum going forward with the right investments, and 
consequently, we are raising our 2018 earnings guidance.</p>
<p> On November 5, we closed on our acquisition of the Camuto Group, 
transforming our organization into one of North America's leading 
designers, producers and retailers of footwear and accessories. We're 
excited to welcome our new associates and wholesale partners to the 
family. We are focusing on delivering on founder Vince Camuto's vision 
for his brand, its associates and its customers. We are also excited 
about the margin opportunities this acquisition creates for the DSW 
brand as a new wholesale, direct-to-customer and licensing revenue 
streams it provides.</p>
<p> Let me turn the call to Jared to provide more details on our financial performance and updated guidance.</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, DSW INC.: Thanks, Roger, and 
good morning, everyone. Let me echo Roger and say how pleased we are to 
report our second consecutive quarter of strong comp and earnings per 
share growth. Our comps in the last 2 quarters have been our strongest 
in 7 years and bring to the -- our year-to-date comp to 6%. Third 
quarter revenues increased by 17% to $833 million this quarter, 
including $80 million from the Canadian Retail segment. On an organic 
basis, excluding the acquisition and business exit, total sales 
increased 10%, driven by a 7% increase in comparable sales. This strong 
volume growth coupled with gross profit rate expanding by 320 basis 
points drove outstanding profitability this quarter.</p>
<p> Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.70, up 56% to 
last year. This includes a loss of $0.02 per share from the operating 
loss related to the wind-down of the Town Shoes banner, which is 
excluded from guidance.</p>
<p> As a reminder, the financials that I will reference during today's 
call exclude GAAP-only items. For a complete reconciliation of adjusted 
to GAAP earnings, please reference our press release.</p>
<p> I would like to give you an update on our largest business, Designer
 Shoe Warehouse, and the product, marketing and people strategy that 
have been driving our outstanding results.</p>
<p> From a product standpoint, all categories posted positive comp 
growth for the second quarter in a row. Our footwear category exceeded 
our expectations, with an 8% comp increase, the sixth quarter in a row 
of positive comp. Women's footwear comped in the high single digits, 
men's in the low single digits and accessories in the low double digits.
 Our strategy for growing the business through key product distortions 
continued as kids and boot categories drove over 79% of the volume 
increase versus last year. Customer demand for fresh fashion drove our 
exceptional boot business this quarter, which was the highest in 3 
years. Our double-digit percentage increase in inventory drove 
double-digit comp growth.</p>
<p> In our kids business, this was our first back-to-school season with 
kids product in all our warehouses. The result was the highest kids 
volume quarter in company history, driven by increased locations and 
strong comp performance and warehouses that have had kids product longer
 than one year. Kids footwear accounts for 10% for the U.S. footwear 
market but goes as high as 20% at our Canadian Retail operation. Thus, 
given these data points, we are confident we have room to significantly 
grow kids footwear at our DSW segment. Men's footwear, including 
athletic, had its second quarter in a row of positive comps, and we 
continue to focus on introducing fresh takes on dress and casual 
comfort. Accessories continued its strong performance producing 
double-digit comps through strong regular-priced selling. Increased 
depth in hosiery and handbags are driving this business.</p>
<p> Our marketing strategies continue to drive strong traffic and 
conversion in our warehouses and e-commerce platforms. Our 2 most 
significant investments in marketing this year are digital marketing and
 VIP rewards relaunch. Increasing digital marketing spend is driving a 
lift in traffic and new customer acquisition. The VIP relaunch, which 
was unveiled in Q2, launched additional perks this quarter, including 
real-time points and rewards accumulation, the ability to donate rewards
 to DSW's nonprofit partners and the ability to earn points for engaging
 with the brand by trying on shoes, filling out customer profiles or 
watching our online videos. These features offer our customers more 
convenience and create a stronger emotional connection with our brand.</p>
<p> Finally, we are excited about our investment in people and the 
foundation our new operating model creates. This was our first full 
quarter under our new operating model in all warehouses, which improves 
our customer experience in 2 key ways. One, it provides role clarity 
between our customer-facing and warehouse execution teams. And two, it 
provides sales coverage and better alignment of payroll hours to peak 
traffic pattern. We will continue to refine this new operating model as 
we provide continuous improvements to our customer experience.</p>
<p> Our Canadian Retail segment and Other business segment also had 
strong performances this quarter. The Canadian Retail segment generated 
$80 million in sales this quarter, with $8 million coming from the 
ongoing exit of the Town Shoes banner. Third quarter, due to 
back-to-school volume, is the highest-volume quarter for these family 
footwear brands. Our leadership's focus on the Shoe Company, Shoe 
Warehouse and DSW Canada banners drove high single-digit comp growth and
 earnings of $0.07 to our Q3 adjusted EPS. We are excited to see the 
business well on its way to drive the $10 million to $15 million of 
annual operating income target that was referenced on our last call.</p>
<p> At our Other business segment, we reported total sales of $30 
million compared to $54 million last year, with the exit of Ebuys and 
Gordmans driving the decline. Our ABG business continued its strong 
momentum with a 7% comp this quarter. We continue to be encouraged with 
the response to our marketing and merchandise initiatives at Stein Mart.
 The ABG business ended the quarter with 287 locations.</p>
<p> Turning to gross profit. Total company gross profit as a percentage 
of sales increased 320 basis points driven by business mix and 
improvement in the DSW segment. On an organic basis, the DSW and ABG 
businesses' gross margin improved by 190 basis points, largely driven by
 stronger regular priced selling, lower clearance markdowns, favorable 
sourcing costs and occupancy leverage at the DSW segment. With our 
inventory discipline, improved sell-through and vendor accountability, 
we are committed to driving gross margin improvements on a sustainable 
basis.</p>
<p> Q3 SG&amp;A expenses increased by 27%, driven by our planned 
investments in marketing, increased bonus expectations and the 
acquisition of our Canadian Retail segment. Growth in our gross profit 
dollars more than offset SG&amp;A growth, delivering operating profits 
up 36% this quarter. Our third quarter adjusted income tax rate 
decreased from 38.3% last year to 24.5%, primarily due to the 
implementation of Tax Reform.</p>
<p> Next, I would like to provide an update on the wind down of the Town Shoes banner and our Camuto Group acquisition.</p>
<p> We have agreed to terms with landlords to exit Town Shoes leases by 
the end of our fiscal year. Total expenses to exit these leases will be 
approximately $20 million, $13 million of which was incurred in Q3 and 
the balance in Q4. In Q3, we also absorbed $13 million in acquisition 
costs related to Camuto Group. These are GAAP-only items and are not 
included in our adjusted earnings per share result.</p>
<p> As it relates to Camuto Group, I would like to share some history 
and color on what attracted us to this acquisition and our near-term 
financial expectation. Camuto Group is one of the premier footwear 
design and production houses in the industry. And as we look to develop 
our own design and production capabilities, we found that the 
opportunity to purchase this well-established, reputable and highly 
experienced infrastructure was just too good to pass up. The fact that 
this premier asset was available at the price we paid was strictly the 
result of unfortunate strategic missteps that severely strained the 
liquidity profile of the Camuto Group. The first of those missteps was a
 big and sudden jump into retail with no prior retail experience. The 
company ultimately exited these retail stores but at a cost well over 
$100 million in cash. The second misstep was bringing online a new 
distribution center during their busiest time of year. Not only were 
there the typical learning-curve issues, but the execution problems were
 so severe that the Camuto Group had to physically shuttle inventory 
between 2 facilities at significant expense, incurred expensive 
personnel and consulting expense to address the operational issues, and 
ultimately miss critical delivery commitments, resulting in excessive 
order cancellations.</p>
<p> This resulted in a significant operating loss for 2017. With these 2
 strategic missteps eroding their working capital, their factory 
partners, who now were experiencing delayed payments from Camuto and 
having just been burned by several industry bankruptcies, including Nine
 West and Rockport, began to dramatically pull back on capacity, slow 
ship orders and increase their costs to cover Camuto's credit risk.</p>
<p> This obviously put significant pressure into the Camuto P&amp;L, 
with increased cost of goods and additional expense to air freight 
products in from China. All the while, Camuto continued to experience a 
higher late delivery rate with their customers than is customary, 
resulting in higher discounting.</p>
<p> What we saw on this opportunity, however, was a design and 
production infrastructure that was built very much in place and fully 
operating, with a reputation that was second to none, but at a price to 
move purchase price as Camuto Group hurried to shore up their liquidity.
 After completing extensive due diligence, we were comfortable that: 
one, there were no material lingering costs related to the retail 
experiment; two, our purchase immediately freed up their liquidity 
profile, bringing their factory partners back to current payment terms 
and restoring them to normal capacity and service levels; and three, our
 own distribution expertise could bring the needed engineering and 
operating guidance they sorely need to optimize and better leverage 
their new state-of-the-art distribution center.</p>
<p> And while the business has immediately benefited from our resources 
and expertise starting on day 1, it will take a little while to show up 
in Camuto's financials. Although the factories are back to normal, the 
lead-time in footwear is nearly 9 months, so we won't see that flow 
through the P&amp;L until later in 2019. Furthermore, the improvements 
with the distribution center operations will take a few months to 
develop and fully implement. As such, we are approaching the fourth 
quarter and 2019 with an appropriate level of conservatism. Our guidance
 assumes the acquisition will be $0.05 to $0.10 dilutive to the fourth 
quarter. It should be noted, however, that this is not the quarterly run
 rate of the business. Their businesses is cyclical throughout the year,
 as is ours, and their fourth quarter is one of their weakest quarters 
from a sales and operating income performance. Accordingly, if you were 
to look at their full 2018 year, they are projecting to lose 
approximately $10 million before tax. Included in this amount is $9 
million of interest expense, which immediately goes away with our 
acquisition. Thus, given ongoing improvements, future enhancements as we
 further learn the business and synergies we expect to see as we 
integrate the business, we believe fiscal '19 results will be in the 
range of marginally dilutive to marginally accretive. With 2020 and 
beyond, we expect the acquisition to deliver double-digit earnings per 
share accretion as we move the sourcing of our own exclusive brand 
volume onto Camuto Group's infrastructure. While we will remain a house 
of brands, we will accelerate the growth of our exclusive brands, which 
will enable us to gain greater control of our product destiny and exert 
greater leverage with the vendor community.</p>
<p> From a growth perspective, we are excited to see Camuto's long and 
deep relationships with their wholesale and private label customers 
remain solid, with spring 2019 orders on track to increase from last 
year. As we support Camuto Group's wholesale business, keep in mind that
 our Affiliated Business Group has long served third-party retailers 
with a business-to-business model. A good example is our long-standing 
relationship with Stein Mart to help them drive sales. Our investments 
in marketing and our strong assortment are helping drive store traffic 
and, consequently, our footwear department has comped 8% year-to-date, 
which is clearly one of the best-performing departments in that chain. 
We will tap this business-to-business experience to protect and grow our
 long-standing and meaningful relationships with our Camuto Group 
wholesale customers. We are absolutely committed to preserving this 
wholesale and private label business and look forward to expanding our 
addressable market beyond our traditional channel.</p>
<p> Finally, we are excited to bring our best-in-class 
direct-to-consumer expertise and infrastructure to the Camuto 
organization to build their own DTC business, which is nearly 
nonexistent today. As we have shared repeatedly, technology has allowed 
established brands to increasingly bypass traditional retail channels 
and go direct to the consumer. And while most of Camuto's peers have 
been focusing on and growing this business, Camuto has not developed 
this capability in any meaningful way. We believe that this is a huge 
white space for the Camuto Group.</p>
<p> Turning to the balance sheet. Excluding inventory from our Canadian 
Retail segment and exited businesses last year, inventory per square 
foot was 10% above last year, with kids accounting for nearly 1/3 of 
that increase. On a 2-year basis, inventory per square foot increased by
 8%, which is in line with our 2-year comp growth of 7%. Our liquidity 
has allowed us to continue to chase goods and opportunistic buys for 
next year. Inventories at our Canadian Retail segment declined by 24%, 
with dramatic improvements in inventory aging and healthier profit 
margin.</p>
<p> Our strong capital position enables us to invest in our core 
business, while strategically acquiring assets that can leverage our 
expertise and expand our customer base.</p>
<p> We ended the quarter with $294 million in cash and cash investments 
compared to last year's $330 million. Our balance sheet does not reflect
 the $238 million paid for the acquisition of Camuto Group, which was 
closed in the fourth quarter. We spent $15 million in CapEx this 
quarter, including $2 million for our Canadian Retail segment. Full year
 CapEx is expected to be $80 million this year, including incremental 
CapEx from our Canadian acquisition.</p>
<p> For our organic businesses, we're on budget with our $70 million of 
CapEx spend, which is primarily driven by store maintenance, DSW Kids 
and our new store design pilot. We ended the quarter with 519 warehouses
 in the U.S., with a net 2 new openings this quarter. We plan to open 3 
to 6 net new locations this year. In Canada, we closed 3 Town Shoes 
locations and 1 Shoe Warehouse, for a total of 172 locations at 
quarter-end.</p>
<p> Turning to our outlook for 2018. Based on our continued strong 
momentum across all of our businesses, we're raising our comp and 
earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect full year comps to 
increase in the mid-single to high-single-digit range and expect total 
revenues to grow in the 12% to 14% range. This will put us over $3 
billion in top line revenues for the first time.</p>
<p> The forecast assumes revenues of $215 million from our Canadian 
Retail segment and approximately $100 million from the Camuto Group 
acquisition.</p>
<p> We've raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share 
for our ongoing business to range from $1.70 to $1.85 compared to our 
previous outlook of $1.60 to $1.75 excluding business exits. It should 
be noted that this guidance includes $0.05 to $0.10 of a headwind from 
the Camuto business. Although results from our business exits are 
included in our adjusted earnings, we believe excluding them better 
reflects the results from our ongoing operations.</p>
<p> As a reminder, the wind-down of the Town Shoes banner has driven a 
$0.03 operating loss and Ebuys resulted in a $0.04 loss for a total 
$0.07 loss year-to-date.</p>
<p> We incorporated a table in our press release that allows you to see 
the guidance increase, including and excluding Camuto Group, and the 
year-to-date business impacts mentioned above.</p>
<p> Excluding the $0.07 loss from our year-to-date adjusted EPS of $1.72
 implies Q4 adjusted earnings per share will range from a loss of $0.09 
to a gain of $0.06 per share, down substantially to last year, as I 
previously pointed out. The main drivers are, one, while comp sales are 
expected to remain strong in Q4, DSW segment will be done to last year 
in Q4 as a result of losing the 53rd week and a calendar shift in which 
we lose a high-volume week of October but pick up a low-volume week of 
February. The volume losses in our biggest business will cause 
substantial earnings decline and deleverage in the total P&amp;L for Q4.</p>
<p> Two, clearance markdown dollars will be up to last year in Q4 
despite the decline in volume. The week that we pick up in February is a
 higher-markdown week due to the clearing and out season goods. Also, we
 had a record low clearance markdown rate last year due to low inventory
 levels, which we will not anniversary this year.</p>
<p> Three, the Camuto Group acquisition is estimated to be $0.05 to 
$0.10 dilutive in Q4. And lastly, our Canadian Retail segment, excluding
 the operating loss from the wind down of Town Shoes, is expected to be 
earnings neutral in Q4. The fourth quarter is an anomaly this year and 
is not reflective of the outstanding business we have had year-to-date, 
nor the trajectory of the business into 2019. This year will be one of 
the strongest earnings performances in company history, and we look to 
improve upon that in 2019.</p>
<p> With that, let me turn the call over to Roger to share his closing thoughts on the state of the business.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: Thanks, Jared. Our strategic objective to gain 
market share in 2018 is delivering better-than-expected results. I'm 
excited and proud that we will become a $3 billion retail business in 
2018. Next year, with a full year of the Canadian Retail segment and 
Camuto Group's wholesale business in our sales, we will be well on our 
way to $4 billion in annual revenue, which includes approximately $500 
million from Camuto Group's businesses. This wholesale and private label
 business represents approximately $1 billion in downstream retail 
sales, thus giving DSW Inc. the ability to participate in close to $5 
billion of footwear market share.</p>
<p> From 2011 to 2018, we drove $1 billion of top line growth, with 
approximately $1 billion investment in over 200 store build-outs, 
operating costs and inventory. During this time frame, we captured 
modest market share as pure-play e-commerce companies and brands who 
were going direct-to-consumers made significant market share gains.</p>
<p> As we were making these investments, the footwear market changed 
significantly. So to stay relevant, we must change. We must look for new
 markets and play at different spots in the supply chain to remain an 
industry leader. The acquisitions we made over the past 6 months have 
added more market share than the $1 billion investment we made over the 
past 6 years and will transform our company into the most disruptive 
force in the industry while enabling us to grow well into the future.</p>
<p> To conclude our prepared remarks, I want to summarize what I see as 
our key accomplishments now that we are 3 quarters into 2018. First, we 
continue to beat earnings and comp sales expectations, driven by the 
outstanding execution against our core strategy. In 2018, we will have 
our strongest comp performance since 2011 and highest earnings per share
 since 2013. This is the second quarter in a row where we have raised 
guidance, with our new guidance midpoint going up $0.10 from the 
previous guidance.</p>
<p> Second, we completed our Canadian Retail segment acquisition at the 
beginning of Q2, and it is already accretive to our annual earnings. The
 addition of Bill Jordan as President and Mary Turner as Chief Operating
 Officer have been crucial to the success we are seeing, as they have 
the team focused on growing profitable results.</p>
<p> Third, we completed the Camuto Group acquisition at the beginning of
 the fourth quarter, immediately giving us world-class design and 
sourcing capabilities that will generate access to new revenue streams, 
transform our business and accelerate future growth.</p>
<p> And lastly, we continue to innovate. We are expanding our W Nail Bar
 and footwear repair services to more locations. We will continue to 
test new fixture packages that drive better customer experience. DSW has
 long been an innovator, and we will continue to test ideas that provide
 exceptional and differentiated customer experiences. We must find ways 
to emotionally connect consumers with our brand and the brands of our 
retail partners. Our core businesses, along with our recent 
acquisitions, will work to create a force in the industry, unlike 
anything that exists today, once again demonstrating DSW Inc.'s ability 
to disrupt and grab meaningful market share.</p>
<p> I want to thank our leaders and all our associates for driving these
 remarkable third quarter results. Their passion and energy to realize 
our vision is certainly an inspiration to me. We'll keep operating with 
focused tempo and disruption as we transform our business for long-term 
sustainable growth.</p>
<p> With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And the first question will be from Rick Patel of Needham &amp; Company.</p>
<p> RAKESH BABARBHAI PATEL, SENIOR ANALYST, NEEDHAM &amp; COMPANY, LLC, 
RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you help us with the modeling Camuto as we think 
about the fourth quarter and 2019? Any context on that business' 
stand-alone gross margins and SG&amp;A versus DSW would be helpful. And I
 was also hoping you could talk about the pathway to accretion. It 
sounds like you need to make some additional investments before we can 
see that segment improve. So just curious how we should be thinking 
about the overall sales growth for that segment versus expense growth 
over the next few quarters?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: Yes. I'll start with that. We are still really 
getting our hands around that business and how to put the financial 
disciplines in place around projections and modeling and things like 
that. I will tell you, on a -- on an overall run rate, on a more 
normalized basis, they tend to be relatively similar to our own 
operating income margins. So I don't see a great deal of accretion or 
dilution from a rate standpoint. As I mentioned in the call, they still 
have some headwinds facing them throughout '19. Many of those, almost 
well over half of them, went away with our acquisition. The liquidity 
freed up, the factories have all been brought current and capacity is 
starting to be restored. But that is going to take more time to bleed in
 just given the lead times. I mean, spring orders have long been already
 started to be queued in the factories and so we've got some time to see
 that flow through. But in general, on a healthy operating basis, you 
see them at an operating-margin rate similar to ours. Where we do see 
some opportunities are really in the white space areas we talked about, 
and those are retail areas. So you can expect to see some different 
margin profiles related to growth in retail sales for them versus their 
traditional wholesale channels. And I think you asked about CapEx, but 
overall, we don't see a large amount of capital expenditures. We think 
there's a little bit needed to bring their operating efficiency to their
 warehouse. But overall, they've made the investments that they need to.</p>
<p> RAKESH BABARBHAI PATEL: That's very helpful. And I was also hoping 
you could talk about the outlook for merchandise margins for the core 
DSW segment when we exclude the impact of weekly shifts? Your 
performance in 3Q is very strong and in contrast to some of the numbers 
we've seen out of the value space. So can you provide a little bit more 
color on what you think drove the strength there and your outlook as we 
think about the fourth quarter, excluding the shifts, and into next 
year?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: Rick, I'll take that question. Rather than talk about
 Q4, what I'd say is just general direction of where we believe our 
margins should be able to go. I think a huge benefit we've had over the 
last -- it's been roughly about 9 months of doing diligence around both 
Nine West and Camuto, is our learning in that processes is that in 
general, we pay more for goods than others. And I think the learning of 
what it actually costs to manufacture goods, how we can be better within
 the DSW brand around the sourcing side, around logistics, speed to 
market, there are huge learnings we're getting from this. So our belief 
is that we are going to continue to press hard on the vendor community 
to make us comparable to like-sized retailers, and I think that should 
create upside for us go forward in margin. And that's a huge benefit 
that I think of acquiring this kind of capability to just get line of 
sight to what it actually costs to manufacture goods.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And the next question will be from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p> PAUL TRUSSELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: Just wanted to maybe touch a bit more on the VIP rewards 
program since the relaunch. Obviously, you're having some success there.
 Just maybe go a little bit more in detail on what you're seeing in 
terms of customer acquisition, average kind of spending levels. Would 
just be helpful to have a little bit more granular color on the success 
and potential kind of how we can think about the sustainability of the 
success with that program going forward.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: Now, thanks, Paul. I'm not going to give you 
specifics, but I would tell you it's the ultimate win, it's the 
triple-play kind of thing, in that it's attracting more members, we have
 a higher retention and we're getting a higher spend, which as you know 
in retail, that's about as good as it can get. And so Amy and our team 
that lead that marketing effort have done a phenomenal job; really, 
really proud of what they've done. And it's not just about the certs and
 all the discounts, those kinds of benefits, but it's about the 
connection, I think, it creates for the consumer. I think our 
philanthropic efforts around Soles4Souls, which I think we're now at 
close to 600,000 pairs of shoes, something north of that, that we have 
been able to collect and put back into our communities and -- I mean, 
those kind of things -- those are resonating with our customer and 
attracting a new customer and creating more loyalty with our customers. 
So all of the things we had set out to do with this relaunch, which if 
you recall, Paul, we had not touched this in a meaningful way in about 
10 years. And so I think it was time for us to make some changes. But I 
think all of those elements combined is where we're seeing success. And 
as you look out into the future, to your question, I think when you 
merge into this elements of services and other capabilities we can bring
 to bear with personalization, I think there is continued growth in that
 area.</p>
<p> PAUL TRUSSELL: And you also mentioned, I believe, that kids and 
boots drove over 79% of the volume increase versus last year. As we kind
 of break that down for the kids business, can you help us understand, 
what did you see out of the stores that actually have had kids now for 2
 back-to-school seasons, as we kind of think about comps in the kids 
business versus just additional stores that have the assortment? And on 
the boots side, just curious of your view on the sustainability of that 
strength into 4Q.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: It's a great question, Paul. We have seen real 
success with kids, not just in the fact that it's in more doors, but 
it's close to -- it's double-digit comps in stores that have -- or 
warehouses that have had it for multiple years. And I think the 
learnings we have from our Canadian operation, where when we see kids 
penetrate up to 10%, 15%, 20% during certain periods of time that we're 
nowhere near that here in the U.S., we think there is continued upside 
to the kids business. From a boots perspective, I can't speak to Q4, but
 I think just in general, an investment in boots is a good investment 
for us. And I was just looking at this last night, you get back and look
 at history, our penetration even as good as we've been in Q3 is still 
well below where it was if you go back to sort of our heyday. And this 
comes back to us focusing our efforts on our [best-at wins] at 
categories, putting our inventory behind it, putting this freight 
marketing machine we have behind it and then elevating that boot 
assortment in the warehouses so that a consumer can see it. And I think 
there is more upside to that. So those are things -- this comes back to 
sort of we had just done a ton of work around our mission and our vision
 and our strategies. And these things are playing out exactly like we 
had penciled them, and we're using data to make those decisions.</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: I would add to that, Paul, that the learnings that 
we're getting from our Canadian company, where kids is much heavier, 
especially during the third quarter, are things that we're able to kind 
of reverse imports back here into the United States and really has 
informed the way we're approaching going to market here and dealing with
 this opportunity that Roger talked about.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And the next question will be from Richard Magnusen for Jeff Van Sinderen of B. Riley FBR.</p>
<p> RICHARD FREDERICK MAGNUSEN, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, B. RILEY FBR, INC., 
RESEARCH DIVISION: Regarding Camuto acquisition, can you provide any 
details regarding growing the brand internationally versus domestically 
and what intentions you may have regarding the longer-term international
 target of growing that brand?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: I think with the Camuto brand, right now our focus
 is how do we strengthen it here in the U.S. That's what I would tell 
you for us. How we can do a better job of bringing that brand to life in
 a more meaningful way within our partners at Macy's, Nordstrom, 
Dillard's, other locations. Those are all opportunities. And then the 
international play will be more with ABG and the relationship we've 
built there and leveraging their expertise. Because what we've seen from
 them in the brands that they have acquired and grown, a large chunk of 
that has come internationally. And so we'll be working with ABG to make 
that happen.</p>
<p> RICHARD FREDERICK MAGNUSEN: Okay. And then what more can you tell us
 about expectations to leverage the Camuto operations along with any 
digital capabilities to strengthen and then further develop your own 
private label portfolio?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: Yes. So I would describe it as -- it's a 
significant opportunity. And I'll start first with the private brands 
side. I think if you guys go, and I know you do this research, and look 
at other retailers, and where they are growing their business and where 
their focus is, a lot of it is on private brand. And when I compare our 
performance to others, we are underpenetrated there. So I think our 
expectation is that over the next 12 months, we would love to have our 
portfolio of private brands to be manufactured, I should say, designed 
and sourced by our Camuto enterprise. So I think that has significant 
upside. Our vision of trying to get that to be closer to 25%, 30% of 
what you would see in the nonathletic space, that's where we would like 
to get to, but still have roughly 800 labels that we would carry. But 
you'd see a much higher penetration of key items provided by Camuto to 
us. I think that's the biggest opportunity. And then on the other side, 
the direct-to-consumer, as Jared had mentioned in his comments, we have 
significant upside here. I think our team here at Designer Shoe 
Warehouse does a fantastic job with our website. I think our experiences
 we've created in the omnichannel, which have been recognized, are 
second to none. And how do we bring those things to life at Camuto 
across all of the brands that we manage now in that portfolio as well as
 brands that ABG is going to give us access to? So I think if you look 
at the competitive landscape, the 2 largest players that have grown in 
our space, it's been Amazon and it's been brands going direct to 
consumer. And the area where I'd say the biggest opportunity within the 
Camuto enterprise itself is to find ways for that brand to be able to go
 direct to consumer.</p>
<p> RICHARD FREDERICK MAGNUSEN: Okay. Then one last one. As you've 
managed the inventory somewhat in chase mode, can you describe more how 
it enabled you to maintain -- really improve margins versus giving up 
some sales? And then how you feel the inventory is positioned as you 
approach the last 2 final weeks and 2 final weekends before Christmas?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: We can't speak to the inventories for Christmas. 
But what I would say, what I think our merchants with Debbie and the 
team have done a fantastic job of doing is, again, they've invested in 
key items. And they've put depth behind those key items, which have put 
our in-stocks in best position, and I've been here a long time it feels 
like at times and a short time at other times. But I think it's the best
 we've had our inventory positioned as it's consumer-facing. And that's 
because they made investments in key items, they went behind it -- or 
got behind it with lots of inventory, and I'm really, really proud of 
that. And I think we can do even better at that as we head into future 
periods.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And the next question will be from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity.</p>
<p> CAMILO R. LYON, MD &amp; HEAD OF US CONSUMER RESEARCH, CANACCORD 
GENUITY LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just thinking about what's going on 
in the marketplace with respect to China tariffs and [those tiers] 
escalating potentially extending different categories, the risks 
associated with that as well as the moves that other manufacturers and 
brands are taking to diversify their exposure two-time. How do you view 
-- does it alter your view on Camuto sourcing arm capabilities and the 
strength that you view from that production perspective, because that 
capability is mainland-driven? So is there a way that you start to 
mitigate any potential risks around Camuto's manufacturing exposure?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: Camilo, I think as I mentioned earlier, one of the
 big benefits that we have through the acquisition is just line of sight
 into cost of goods for DSW, the brands, ABG, our ABG, Affiliated 
Business Group, and a recognition that we're paying too much for 
product. And when we look at where we have opportunity to mitigate 
tariffs, I think it's a combination of things. It would be to go get 
dollars back from the vendor community where we can see that we are 
paying too much for product. And we think that is a way in which we can 
mitigate a large portion of that risk. What I like about our team at 
Camuto and the work that they were doing well before we got involved is,
 they've been looking for other ways to move outside of China. We also 
have manufacturing in Brazil, and they're looking at our countries. So I
 think the combination of going back to the vendor community to be able 
to deal with some of the tariff challenges, going larger on some of our 
key items so that you get the benefits of having depth behind inventory,
 which means you also get better costing, and then obviously, there 
would be some areas where I think you would pass it onto a consumer. I 
think we have a pretty good game plan for how we will deal with it. Our 
preference would be not to have to do that. But in the event that it 
does happen, I think, I do feel like we have a plan to address it.</p>
<p> CAMILO R. LYON: Got it. Jared, you talked about spring orders being 
up for Camuto. Does that -- is that an overall Camuto comment? Or does 
that also apply to the private label piece of the business?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: What -- go ahead.</p>
<p> CAMILO R. LYON: And then my second question around private label, is
 if you could just articulate on the DSW business? How private label 
performed in women's versus branded performance in women's? And if there
 was any delta in the comps between the 2 categories?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: Sure. On your first question. What I was referring to
 specifically was the health of their underlying wholesale business. So 
it was specifically around their major existing customers. And when we 
look at the spring orders versus spring of last year, they are trending 
to be greater than what they were last year. So it was in context to 
primarily their wholesale business. We, as I mentioned, are still 
getting our hands around how we are going to report out and talk about 
their overall business. And to be perfectly honest, I have not landed on
 how much visibility we give into the private label business. That tends
 to be a little more held to the chest -- held to vest with some of the 
customers there. From a DSW standpoint, our private label performance in
 women's was, I think, slightly better than the branded performance, but
 there's still significant opportunity for growth in our overall private
 label business. As Roger mentioned, we think that, that business is 
something well north of where it's at, and our Camuto acquisition gives 
us the infrastructure to be able to handle that.</p>
<p> CAMILO R. LYON: Got it. And then just finally, clearly, the VIP 
rewards refresh, if you will, is having the intended benefits, right? 
It's helping with comps. If there is a component of marketing around it 
they talked about, how should we think about kind of the SG&amp;A 
profile of the business with -- over the next year and the run rate of 
SG&amp;A dollar growth as it relates to these investments around 
marketing? Are these investments that you will continue to be making or 
are they more kind of onetime in nature to reacclimate the consumer to 
this new revamped, reformatted VIP membership program?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: One, we don't want to give too much color yet around 
'19 or beyond Q4 because that's something that we have not put out there
 publicly. What I will say is, we've seen great results from our 
investment in marketing. Like with anything, there are some things that 
resonate very, very well, some things don't resonate quite as well as 
you thought. And so I think that there will be an opportunity to look at
 maximizing those dollars, or optimizing those dollars and making sure 
that we're getting the most spend for it. Without that, I don't want to 
give too much color into '19 yet.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And the next question will be from Christopher Svezia of Wedbush.</p>
<p> CHRISTOPHER SVEZIA, SVP OF EQUITY RESEARCH, WEDBUSH SECURITIES INC.,
 RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess just on the guidance of $1.70, $1.85 in 
earnings, just unclear -- it includes the $0.05 to $0.10 loss related to
 Camuto but also excludes the $0.07 related to these non-go-forward 
businesses, which was in your 9 months so far, but we don't have a kind 
of a pro forma to kind of break that out from a P&amp;L perspective. So I
 guess the way we're looking at it, on an annualized basis, just is more
 like a $1.63, $1.78. Just kind of understand where I'm going with this?
 Does that -- am I thinking about that right?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: Yes. And I'd be happy to go over more specific 
modeling questions on the one-on-ones, so we can dig into that. I think 
if you look at the $1.72 year-to-date adjusted earnings, that includes 
that $0.07 of business exits. So if you're looking at the business 
excluding that, you'd have to add those 2 together. But that $1.72 run 
rate is the -- is where we're at.</p>
<p> CHRISTOPHER SVEZIA: Okay. On Camuto. You made the observation that 
you've lost -- roughly the run rate in '18 is roughly a $10 million 
loss, of which $9 million is interest expense related. And you expect to
 be sort of slightly dilutive, slightly accretive for next year. There's
 also a lot of separate moving parts, the licensing fee income or fee 
that you're going to be giving to Authentic Brands and the 40% you get 
against that. So fully loaded margin on Jessica Simpson, I think a Lucky
 brand. Is that all embedded into that thought process? Or any color 
about how we think about those moving parts. Because I would assume that
 $10 million loss doesn't include that -- obviously that licensing fee 
that you're paying to ABG Group, obviously.</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: It does for only the fourth quarter, obviously, 
because that's the only part that was applicable. But yes, so that 
slightly dilutive to slightly accretive for '19 does include the whole 
kit and caboodle, if you will. And to give you just a little bit of 
color, of the royalty payments that we expect to be paying to ABG -- to 
the joint venture, I should make it clear, to the joint venture that we 
own with ABG, over -- well over half of that ends up coming back to us, 
coming back to that joint venture and then our 40% from recouping our 
own royalties, because we're a 40% owner, there's also Apparel that is 
being sold that is paying royalties into that. And there's licensing 
outside of the footwear and apparel space around the other 
lifestyle-type of products. So you take all that and you're left with 
something that is less than half of the royalties that are going out. 
And then you look at the margin enhancements that we get from the 
products already sold to DSW today, that's the Lucky and Jessica type of
 products, that profit margin now stays in the family as well as us 
converting over our private label makes that piece of the puzzle really 
an accretive story as opposed to one being dilutive.</p>
<p> CHRISTOPHER SVEZIA: Okay. And then just finally, you've done a nice 
job on EBIT here. I'm just -- as you start to think about, and you doing
 have to give me any outlook for next year, but just comping the comp 
given how you've outperformed and your confidence in being able to put 
up a positive comp against some of these numbers Q2 to Q3, just maybe if
 you could or any level of which the confidence do you have to be able 
to do that? Just if you maybe add some color about that, that would be a
 little helpful.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: I think the -- there's still lots of runway, I 
believe, and opportunity to continue to grow this business. And if we 
follow the same approach that we've taken this year, which is where we 
are investing in product where we need to differentiate ourselves, an 
example would be going after foods and seasonal -- or sandals, all the 
seasonal categories in a big way, we believe there's still lots of 
headroom there. We believe in the kids business in a meaningful way. And
 as happy as we are with the results we've had, we still are well under 
the penetration that we think we should be based on the information we 
can see from NPD as well as our Canadian operations. So I think there's 
still lots of white space within the assortment. I think the work we've 
done around marketing with the VIP launch, there are other elements of 
that we're going to bring to life, which I'm -- I don't want to share. 
It's some competitive stuff that I'd prefer not to share at this point. 
But personalization is a huge opportunity for us. And having 26 million,
 27 million members of your rewards program and making their experience 
more personalized, it will drive conversion. It will drive traffic and 
it will drive conversion. So those, I think, are a big play. And then 
the third, it's the 3 legs of the stool, it's the people. And I think 
we've acquired the level of talent that we're looking at drive for 5 and
 that's sort of our motto. That's what we're going after, day in and day
 out. That is the expectation that we have to have as the brand. And 
those are the 3 things that, Christopher, I think, we approached this 
year and we think we still have opportunities as we head into 2019 and 
beyond for the DSW brand specifically, is what I'm speaking to.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: The next question will be from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.</p>
<p> DANA LAUREN TELSEY, CEO &amp; CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER, TELSEY 
ADVISORY GROUP LLC: Given the comps that you delivered this quarter and 
what you talked about some of the categories, what did you see on men's 
and women's? What is working for you? Did seasonal make the difference 
this year? And how are price points changing?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: For us, we're -- we don't really give color other 
than the key things we had in our script. But again, it's about boots; 
it's about kids. The things where we are focusing our efforts, again, 
both with product and marketing, I think, those are where the real 
opportunities lie. And then the other element that we haven't spoken to 
in a big way today is the opportunity around services. And when you 
think about the success we've had here in Columbus with our W Nail Bar, 
repairs, orthotics, other kind of services, creating an emotional 
connection with our consumer, bringing those things to life in a much 
larger way, following models that have been created by a brand like Best
 Buy on how they've elevated services in a meaningful way while still 
selling products. Those are all opportunities, I think, as we head into 
'19 and beyond.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And the next question will be from Tom Nikic of Wells Fargo.</p>
<p> TOM NIKIC, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: Yes, I just wanted to ask now that you've got Camuto in-house 
and you're going to have the sort of hybrid operating model with a bunch
 of brick-and-mortar stores, while also running a wholesale business 
that's selling to other partners, can you just talk a little bit about 
sort of balance in the 2 channels and how you don't run into any sort of
 channel conflict there? And anything that you can sort of do to help us
 -- or explain to help us understand the way that you balance the 2 
channels which you will be operating in would be really helpful.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: Yes, Tom. I think the best example I would give 
you is the relationship we have with Stein Mart. And we've been doing 
footwear with Stein Mart for many years. And we have -- I think, if Hunt
 were on this call, he would tell you that we are a key driver for their
 business because footwear is something that attracts a consumer into 
their doors day in and day out. And that has been a great relationship 
that we've had with them. And we've had to balance that as we've managed
 the DSW brand, even though in many cases, we have a DSW that's right 
next to a Stein Mart. So I think we have a history of managing that way.
 What I would tell you is that, as we've shared with our retail 
partners, we do not see them as competitors. And frankly, over the last 
several years, we have not. Our primary competitors that we see are 
Amazon and the brands going direct to consumer. And we've shared that 
with our partners at the other retail segments. And we want to work with
 them to provide them insight to what we see within our customer file at
 the DSW brand, the success we've had with our rewards program, how we 
can help share insights. We want to help them grow their business. And 
we think we're all fighting the same fight. And I think that's how you 
manage that conflict. You see one another as partners, and you provide 
good -- great insight so that the both of you win. And that's the 
approach that we are -- we have been taking and that we will take. And 
frankly, I think that's different than anyone else in our space. The 
insights, I think, we can share compared to others that might want to 
provide that service, I think that puts us in a unique position.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And the next question will be from Sam Poser of Susquehanna.</p>
<p> SAMUEL MARC POSER, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, 
LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just -- Jared, just one quick one on interest 
expense. Can you give us some idea of how you're seeing that?</p>
<p> JARED A. POFF: Yes. So we actually are expected to see an interest 
expense, net interest expense in Q4 as opposed to our traditional 
interest income. And that's primarily because we've decided to take out a
 slug of debt. Although as you noted on the -- you may have noted on the
 press release, we still have also have cash and investments. We've 
decided from a liquidity prudent standpoint that we will keep a turn of 
working capital in cash and cash investments and then fund what we 
needed to on the revolver. So that's what we've modeled out.</p>
<p> SAMUEL MARC POSER: And my question, though, really is, and you 
brought up -- a second ago, to follow-up from Tom's question, you 
brought up your relationship with Stein Mart. But Stein Mart is arguably
 a more moderate retailer than you are, and a lot of the consumers that 
are at -- a lot of the customers of Camuto Group are much higher end? So
 that's a very -- when you're offering higher-end insights to more 
moderate retailers, that's one thing. But when you have retailers, the 
Nordstrom, Dillard's and so on, that would arguably sell higher ticket 
items, have a slightly but maybe more affluent consumer, that moves a 
different direction. Could you explain how that all works, even though 
you have this -- as you have this great relationship with Stein Mart and
 so on?</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: I think as I shared about the information we have 
within our rewards program, where we have roughly 26 million members, 
with a household income that ranges from $75,000 to $100,000, which is a
 pretty strong household income, I think you would agree, in the 
competitive landscape, I think there's insights that we can share based 
on our learnings, and I think those are all things we can share. And you
 take into account the fact that the Camuto Group is staying as it is 
today, and those relationships that they have spent years -- that Vince 
spent years and Alex spent years building with our retail partners, 
there are not changes that we're making there. And I think, again, that 
positions us differently than anyone else that would have acquired this 
enterprise.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our 
question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to
 Roger Rawlins for his closing remarks.</p>
<p> ROGER L. RAWLINS: I just want to say thanks to all of our associates
 on the call, all of our partners as well. Thanks for a great third 
quarter and looking forward to getting through the holidays. Happy 
holidays to you and your family. Have a great day.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has 
concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now 
disconnect your line.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ADF
 Group results for the period ending October 31. (Operator Instructions)
 Also note that this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, December
 5, 2018. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. 
Jean-François Boursier, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
<p> JEAN-FRANçOIS BOURSIER, CFO, ADF GROUP INC.: Good morning, ladies 
and gentlemen. Welcome to ADF's conference call, covering the 3- and 
9-month periods ended October 31, 2018. Please note that Mr. Jean 
Paschini, ADF Group's CEO, is unfortunately unavailable for today's 
conference call.</p>
<p> I will update you on our most recent results and changes in 
financial position, which were disclosed earlier this morning by press 
release, and briefly discuss our operations. I will answer your 
questions at the end of this call.</p>
<p> First, let me remind you that some of the issues discussed today may
 include forward-looking statements. These are documented in ADF Group's
 management report for the periods ended October 31, 2018, which were 
filed with SEDAR this morning.</p>
<p> Revenues for the third quarter stood at $45.6 million compared with 
$37.2 million last year, while year-to-date revenues stood at $106.3 
million compared with $131.1 million a year ago.</p>
<p> The uncertainty coming from the import duties and free trade 
negotiations have significantly impacted our first 2 quarters' revenues.
 This said, and now that is uncertainty is slowly subsiding, we see the 
results from our recently announced contracts and negotiations of 
certain contractual changes favorably impacting our revenues and gross 
margins in the third quarter.</p>
<p> Consequently, the third quarter gross margin as a percentage of 
sales, increased from 6.5% last year to 10.2% this year. For the 9 
months ended last October 31, gross margin as a percentage of revenues 
stood at 7% compared to 9.1% for the same period a year ago.</p>
<p> Besides the elements mentioned just before, the additional 
fabrication volume improved our -- the efficiency of our plants, 
improving the absorption of overhead costs. At the close of the 3 months
 ended October 31, 2018, EBITDA stood at $2.6 million compared to an 
EBITDA of $468,000 a year ago. Year-to-date, EBITDA stood at $1.5 
million compared to an EBITDA of 7 -- of $5.7 million for the 9 months 
ended October 31, 2017.</p>
<p> For the quarter, we posted net earnings of $1.9 million or $0.06 per
 share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $698,000 or $0.02 
per share, basic and diluted, last year. Year-to-date, net earnings 
stood at $458,000 or $0.01 per share, basic and diluted, compared with 
net earnings of $1.6 million a year ago or $0.05 per share, basic and 
diluted.</p>
<p> Besides the elements mentioned just before, the third quarter and 
year-to-date results for the period ended last October 31 were 
positively impacted by income tax recoveries. As you may recall, during 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, ADF wrote 
off certain deferred income tax assets related to its U.S. operations. 
Although these assets were written off, they remain available to the 
corporation as soon as its U.S. operations recorded a profit. As such, 
in light of ADF's U.S. subsidiaries' results for the quarter and 9-month
 period ended October 31, 2018, ADF was able to again recognize certain 
deferred tax assets, thus generating profits without tax expenses.</p>
<p> The impact of these adjustments reduced the income tax expense 
during the 3 months and 9 months periods ended October 31, 2018, by $1.2
 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As discussed on this call a 
quarter ago, we collected significant dollars in August, which improved 
our overall cash situation. Our net cash, which stood at a negative 
$11.7 million as of July 31, 2018, now stands at a positive $0.6 
million. Working capital as of October 31, 2018, at $32.1 million was 
strong and in line with the January 31, 2018 working capital, which 
stood at $34.8 million.</p>
<p> Evidently, cash flow from operations generated in excess of $13 
million for the quarter ended October 31, 2018. Finally, we have 
invested year-to-date $2.8 million in CapEx and expect our full year 
CapEx program not to exceed $4 million.</p>
<p> As we have previously stated on this call, volume is paramount to 
our success and the impact from the uncertainties mentioned earlier 
will, without a doubt, have a negative impact on our fiscal 2019 
results.</p>
<p> This said, and as we have done on numerous occasions, we kept our 
focus on the elements we can control and forged that. More specifically,
 we have taken cost-cutting measures earlier this year. We worked on our
 working capital situation, and we have grown our backlog, which stands 
at $215.8 million as of October 31, 2018.</p>
<p> Since April, we have signed an excess of $200 million in new 
contracts, and we look forward to new announcements in the coming weeks 
and months. With some of these uncertainties subsiding, we look more 
optimistically at the remainder of our fiscal year and next year. This 
temporary setback has not deterred us from our overall goal of growing 
our order backlog, achieve operational excellence while managing our 
liquidities.</p>
<p> This said, ADF's management feel that the present market evaluation 
of its share clearly does not reflect its real and future value, and is 
extremely disappointed with its evaluation. Ladies and gentlemen, thank 
you for your attention. I will now answer your questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And at this time, Mr. Boursier, it
 appears we have no further -- no questions. I would like to turn the 
call over to you.</p>
<p> JEAN-FRANçOIS BOURSIER: Again, I wish to thank you for your interest
 in ADF Group. We will remain available to answer your questions. Have a
 good day.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed 
conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for 
attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your 
lines. Have yourself a great day.</p>

<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Good morning, and welcome to the Seadrill Third Quarter2018 Earnings Conference Call.</p>
<p>(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn the conference over to John Roche, VicePresident, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><b>JOHN T. ROCHE, VP OF IR, SEADRILL LIMITED:</b> Thanks, and goodafternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining Seadrill's ThirdQuarter Earnings Conference Call.</p>
<p>Before we do kick off, I'd like to remind everyone that much of 
thediscussion today will not be based on -- is based -- on 
historicalfact but rather consist of forward-looking statements that 
aresubject to uncertainty. Included on Page 2 of the presentation is 
acomprehensive list covering forward-looking statements. Foradditional 
information and to review our SEC filings, please visitour website at 
seadrill.com.</p>
<p>Now moving on to the agenda. On the call today, you'll hear fromAnton
 Dibowitz, our CEO; and Mark Morris, our CFO, in our preparedremarks. 
And in the room with us for Q&amp;A are Matt Lyne, our ChiefCommercial 
Officer; and Leif Nelson, our Chief Operating Officer.Anton will cover 
off the highlights for the quarter and provide youall with our views on 
the market, the shape of the recovery and howwe're positioned for it. 
Mark will then provide an overview of ourreorganization and how it has 
impacted the presentation of ourfinancial statements and the financial 
performance for the quarter.We'll then open up the line to take some 
questions from you all.</p>
<p>And with that, I'd like to turn over the call to Anton.</p>
<p>Anton?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, SEADRILL LIMITED:</b> Thank you,John, and very good day to everyone on the call.</p>
<p>Before I go into the highlights for the quarter and our thoughts 
forthe future, given that this is our first earnings call in over ayear,
 I'd like to very briefly talk about where we've been. Since welast 
addressed you all, we've made great strides in positioning ourcompany 
for the future. The path was long and paved with difficultdecisions, but
 we made it through with our premium fleet intact andnow the capital 
structure that affords us the ability to capitalizeon the recovery. The 
end result of this challenging process is arecapitalized balance sheet 
with financial flexibility supported bysignificant liquidity position, 
no near-term maturities oramortization and little covenant risk. Our 
operational focus neverwavered, and we continued to contract our efforts
 throughout theprocess. Our customers saw our restructuring for the 
financialexercise that it was, and we have now emerged in a much 
strongerposition.</p>
<p>Before I expand on our view of the recovery, I want to first take 
youthrough some of the key performance metrics and commercial 
successesfor the third quarter.</p>
<p>Operationally, we never took our eye off the ball through 
therestructuring, and the same holds true today. We continue toimplement
 technology in our rigs to facilitate improved assetintegrity, 
operational performance and safety, but it is thededicated and focused 
personnel, both onshore and offshore, and theirability to harness those 
technologies that are driving the highlevels of performance you see. As a
 result, we had another strongoperational quarter, posting uptime of 98%
 with no significantdowntime incidents. And if not more importantly, our
 key safetymetrics continued to lead our peer group of offshore 
drillers.Although it would be nice to have more rigs working, we 
arecomfortable with our current level of utilization when we 
considertoday's dayrates. The financial flexibility we have built allows
 usto make disciplined contracting decisions and to hold back 
supplyuntil dayrates improve. We are focused on maximizing the 
utilizationof our marketed fleet and minimizing spend on assets that are
 coldstacked until contract economics justify reactivating them.</p>
<p>With that backdrop, let's have a look at new business over the 
lastseveral months. Since the end of the second quarter, we signed 
almost$300 million in new business, made up of new contracts, 
exercisedoptions and extensions to existing contracts, and I'd like 
tohighlight a few of those. When looking at floaters, I'm going to 
talkabout 3 contracts. First, the West Hercules contract with 
Equinorprovides another solid data point for the harsh environment 
market,with dayrates continuing to hold strong with contracts 
between$275,000 and $300,000 a day. The Hercules has been contracted 
asEquinor's exploration rig, and we look forward to continuing our 
longrelationship with them with this asset.</p>
<p>Second, the recent signing of a new contract for West Carina is 
ourthird deepwater floater contract with Petronas in the last year. 
Asiarepresents one of the bright spots we see in the floater market 
wherecustomers are willing to compensate contractors 
forhigh-specification units such as the Carina, which is equipped 
withour third-generation MPD system. And third, the contract 
expansionfor the Sevan Louisiana with Walter Oil &amp; Gas further 
positionsthis unique asset class to compete in the mid-water market. The
 rig'scylindrical design allows the rig to effectively work in waters 
asshallow as 850 feet in dynamic positioning mode, saving the 
customertime and money and lowering risk around existing infrastructure 
wheremore rigs have traditionally been used.</p>
<p>We've also had success in the quarter with our jack-up fleet. 2 
itemsI'd like to highlight in this segment are, first, an extension on 
theWest Cressida for Ophir for their development program, which willkeep
 the rig busy into 2020, indicating a return in demand for thejack-up 
market. And second, in Qatar, we signed a contract with GDIto work for 
Qatar gas. The partnership with GDI provides acompetitive advantage in 
an exciting market with potential forsignificant growth in the coming 
years.</p>
<p>Overall, these contracts are reflective of the underlying trends 
weare seeing in the market and our strategy. It's all about the 
rightcontract economics and how they position us for what we see coming 
asthe recovery takes hold.</p>
<p>I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about 
macroeconomicindicators, as I'm sure you've heard ad nauseam about GDP 
growth andthe fact that demand for energy continues unabated. The fact 
of thematter is the fundamental outlook for our business is 
improving.After many years of underspending, our customers are facing 
theinevitability of what follows: the need to replace production. 
Therecent volatility in oil prices has little bearing on how the 
vastmajority of our customers invest. Their time horizon is much 
longer.Even at today's oil prices, the offshore barrel is profitable for
 ourcustomers, competitive with other sources of supply and needed 
tomeet global demand requirements. In addition to the positive 
upstreambackdrop, the drilling industry has seen continued scrapping 
activityand consolidation. These are trends that are supportive of 
improvingforward pricing levels. This is certainly reflected in the 
activitywe're seeing today and expect to see more of based on 
theconversations we are having with our customers.</p>
<p>Stated simply, rates in the harsh environment have recovered to 
thehigh 200s, and we expect these to go higher. Rate for 
benignultra-deepwater floaters are in the mid to high 100s for '19, and 
weexpect to be contracting significantly higher than this level in2020. 
And in the premium benign jack-up market, we see a significantincrease 
in demand levels and this is driving increased pricing.</p>
<p>In closing. We spent a considerable amount of time and effort 
torecapitalize our business and create financial flexibility. Ouryoung, 
modern fleet is made up of the rigs that customers want. 
We'recomfortable with our current fleet utilization levels because 
wefirmly believe that higher dayrates are coming, and we will 
bedisciplined in how and where we deploy our capital and continue tohave
 a laser focus on cost. Our continued focus on cost efficiencyand the 
best people in the business is a powerful combination thatputs us in the
 prime position to capitalize on the recovery.</p>
<p>I will say that, reading the analyst reports this morning, it 
appearsthat many of you feel that this is a comeback for us. From 
aquarterly reporting standpoint, that may be true, but in reality 
itcouldn't be further from the truth. We've been here for years. 
Wecontinued to execute our core business while we restructured 
ourbalance sheet. We look forward to being here for many years to 
comeand making this the most successful and profitable driller in 
theindustry.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to turn over to Mark to take us through the Q3financials.</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS, CFO OF SEADRILL MANAGEMENT LTD &amp; SVP OF SEADRILLMANAGEMENT LTD, SEADRILL LIMITED:</b> Thank you, Anton. Well, goodmorning and good afternoon, wherever you are.</p>
<p>As you heard, it's been an eventful quarter with us -- for us, 
havingemerged from Chapter 11 on the 2nd of July, applied 
reorganizationand fresh-start accounting and having relisted on the Oslo
 StockExchange while maintaining a continued listing on the New York 
StockExchange. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking 
aboutfresh-start accounting. However, it is just worth highlighting 
acouple of key points to understand what it is and what it does.</p>
<p>Fresh start effectively treats us like a brand-new company. Ourassets
 and liabilities have been fair valued in line with thedistributable 
value approved by the U.S. bankruptcy court, which isan asset value of 
about $11 billion. It creates adjustments to ourassets and liabilities 
that have a one-off impact at the point ofemergence as well as 
adjustments that will have a recurring impact tofuture quarters. All of 
these adjustments are noncash items. All ofthis is covered in a huge 
amount of detail in the 6-K and F-1documents, which I do not propose to 
go through here other than tosay it is a complex and technical area. 
We've included for referencethe main recurring adjustments as an 
appendix to the press release sothese can be factored into your models. 
These will arise through theOpEx, interest expense and investments in 
associated company linesgoing forward. Importantly, revenue and EBITDA 
figures will not beaffected by any fresh-start adjustments.</p>
<p>The key takeaway here, though, for our first quarter post emergenceis
 that there are no comparables, so this is our first clean quarter.</p>
<p>So now turning to the financials.</p>
<p>Of our 35 rigs, 16 were working on average throughout the quarter: 
7floaters at an average dayrate of $240,000 per day with 97% uptimeand 9
 jack-ups at an average dayrate of $98,000 per day with 98%uptime. It 
was a strong quarter operationally for us. With regard toour reported 
OpEx and G&amp;A, it is worth reminding everyone that inaddition to the 
35 rigs we own and consolidate in our accounts, wealso manage 11 rigs 
for Seadrill Partners, 5 rigs for SeaMex and 2rigs for Northern 
Drilling. The management of our partners' rigsincurs both OpEx and 
G&amp;A-related expenditure, which is includedin our reported figures. 
These related costs are charged out on acost-plus basis to our partners 
and recognized in other revenues.</p>
<p>Our reported G&amp;A for the quarter of $31 million includes 
$14million that has been charged to our partners, so the G&amp;A 
thatrelates directly to the management for the 35 rigs we own 
andconsolidate is $17 million. G&amp;A for the quarter is a little 
lowerthan our expected run rate, reflecting a change to certain 
accrualsfollowing the completion of the restructuring. Going forward, 
weexpect reported G&amp;A to be around $150 million per year, of 
whichapproximately 30% to 35% will be recovered from our 
partners.Similarly, reported OpEx for the quarter of $162 million 
includes$7.5 million related to rigs we manage.</p>
<p>We continue to focus relentlessly on cost reduction, and we've 
madesignificant progress in reducing OpEx and G&amp;A over the last 
fewyears. Our average daily running cost is approximately $120,000 
perday for benign floaters and $40,000 per day for benign jack-ups. 
Forour cold stacked units, daily costs are around $10,000 and 
$4,000,respectively.</p>
<p>Moving on to the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Most of it is self-explanatory following the reorganization 
andfresh-start adjustments and the $1.1 billion of fresh capital 
thatcame in as part of the broader restructuring. Total cash stood 
at$2.1 billion at the quarter end and includes $560 million ofrestricted
 cash.</p>
<p>Just pulling out a few key items here. Restricted cash of $560million
 comprises of $126 million of West Rigel proceeds that havesubsequently 
been used to redeem the new secured notes at par; $227million of 
escrowed collateral for the new secured notes, which waspart of the 
restructuring agreement; a $56 million loan repaymentfrom Sapura Energy,
 which is pledged as security to the new securednotes; and $102 million 
of cash back in certain guarantee and letterof credit facilities. 
Drilling units and investments in associatedcompanies both reflect fresh
 start movements, which have seen theircarrying values reduce by circa 
$5.7 billion and $670 million,respectively. Again, there's plenty of 
details in the 6-K.</p>
<p>Amounts due from related parties primarily relate to $390 million 
ofloans to SeaMex; around $200 million of receivables from 
SeadrillPartners, mainly comprised of trading balances and adjustment to
 the-- for the West Vela earnout previously not on the balance sheet 
butnow included as part of fresh start. $100 million relates to loans 
tothe Seabras joint venture. And a $47 million loan to Archer.</p>
<p>Lastly, in relation to the current debt of $165 million, this 
relatesto 2 components: the West Rigel proceeds that we were holding in 
Q3for redemption of the new secured notes that occurred in Q4, which isa
 one-off; and the annual paydown of Ship Finance bank debtfacilities, 
which we consolidate on our balance sheet and asvariable-interest 
entities, representing the 3 rigs we have on leasefrom Ship Finance.</p>
<p>So we've talked on the previous slide about the $2.1 billion of 
cash.Now let's just recap on our capital structure following emergence.</p>
<p>Our $5.7 billion of bank loans mature between 2022 and 2024. Andthere
 is no amortization until 2020 and potentially until 2021 if weelect to 
use the $500 million amortization and conversion electionfacility. Our 
$880 million of new secured notes mature in 2025 andcomprise of 4% cash 
interest and 8% PIK. We have a number ofredemption mechanisms included 
in the indenture, which allow us toretire the notes via asset sales that
 have been pledged to securityfor the new secured notes or by raising 
capital at Seadrill Limited,and you will have seen that we have already 
redeemed $126 million ofthe new secured notes already.</p>
<p>Retiring the new secured notes will be a high priority for us 
goingforward. While there is no bank debt amortization on maturities, 
wedo have 3 rigs on lease from Ship Finance Limited. These leases 
areaccounted for as variable-interest entities and the debt of 
$713million is consolidated on our balance sheet. As part of 
therestructuring, we've negotiated a limited set of financial 
covenantsto ensure we have adequate flexibility through the recovery. We
 have1 covenant until 2021, which is the minimum liquidity 
covenant.Thereafter, we have an additional 2 covenants that come into 
effectin 2021, being net leverage and debt service cover ratio. Lastly, 
ourexposure to interest rates is limited through the purchase ofinterest
 rate caps that were taken out in Q2. We're about 80% hedgedto the 
protected rate of 2.87%. The interest rate caps extend out to2023.</p>
<p>It's just worth reminding everyone that in addition to owning 
andoperating our 35 rigs, we have 4 other significant investments 
thatare not consolidated which are recognized in marketable 
securitiesand investments in associated companies. These are Seadrill 
Partners,in which we effectively own a 65% economic interest through 
ourvarious investment holdings; SeaMex, which is a 50-50 joint 
venturewith our partner Fintech; Seabras Sapura, which is a 50-50 
jointventure with our partner Sapura Energy; and lastly, Archer, in 
whichwe hold a 16% equity interest. You can read the details 
foryourselves, but it's worth noting the combined backlog, 
contractterms, EBITDA, debt and cash held at these entities alongside 
ourrespective interests in them. We believe these represent 
materialvalue for us going forward.</p>
<p>Since the end of the third quarter, we've completed a mandatory 
parredemption of approximately $126 million of our new secured 
notesrelated to the West Rigel proceeds. We also launched a $56 
millionmandatory offer at 103 related to the proceeds received from 
amaturing loan to Sapura Energy. On expiry, approximately $150,000 
wastendered in total, owing mainly to the fact that the notes 
weretrading above 103.</p>
<p>We've completed an agreement that extinguished $486 million 
ofguarantees related to our joint venture Seabras Sapura. In return 
forextinguishing the guarantees, the lenders received a prepayment 
fromthe joint venture; cross collateralization of the 
relevantfacilities; and an increase in margin; and a consent fee, again 
paidfor by the joint venture. Finally, we also received $35 million as 
apartial repayment of shareholder loans provided to Seabras Sapura.</p>
<p>And now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter. EBITDA 
isexpected to be slightly lower for Q4. This primarily relates toG&amp;A
 returning to more normalized levels for Q4, which will beslightly 
higher than Q3 due to certain one-off changes to relatedrestructuring 
accruals not being repeated.</p>
<p>So to summarize. It's great to be back reporting quarters on aregular
 basis. Our restructuring has given us the opportunity torecapitalize 
the balance sheet and provide financial flexibilitywhile we wait for the
 recovery. We believe our large modern fleet andproven operational track
 record positions us well with our customers,and our continuing focus on
 cost reduction will help ensure we remaincompetitive. We believe there 
is also significant value in ournonconsolidated investments. And 
finally, as Anton said, we are notgoing to get drawn into contracting 
long term in a relatively lowdayrate environment and we have a premium 
fleet and financialflexibility. We will be patient so we can take the 
right deals.</p>
<p>And with that, I will turn over to John to start the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><b>JOHN T. ROCHE:</b> Thanks, Mark.</p>
<p>While we assemble the queue for questions, I'd just like to 
request,if there's any technical accounting or model-oriented questions,
 thatwe take those offline. Happy to spend as much time as required 
withyou all to help you understand that.</p>
<p>And with that, I will turn over to the operator to take our firstquestion.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) The first question will come fromMike Urban of Seaport Global.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL WILLIAM URBAN, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, SEAPORT GLOBALSECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 So as you've been going throughthe restructuring process, you've seen 
quite a bit of consolidationin the broader space. How do you see 
yourselves going forward? Is itmostly executing on the business and now 
that you've got a betterbalance sheet and liquidity profile? Or is there
 an opportunity toparticipate in the consolidation that's been going on?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Thanks for the question, Mike. Well, first 
off, I'llsay consolidation is great for the industry, and we welcome 
it,whether it's done by us or done by others. Having fewer, morerational
 players in the business makes for a better business foreverybody. It 
increases contracting discipline amongst the playersthat are there. 
Generally, when M&amp;A happens, it gives people alicense to execute 
scrapping that needs to take place, that needs tocontinue to take place.
 Obviously, we're not going to lay our cardson where we see ourselves in
 that space, but I think if you can lookat our history and DNA as a 
company, you'll see that we very seldomsat on our hands. We have a very 
active anchor shareholder. And if a-- if the right opportunity is there,
 we will certainly take part init, but for us, M&amp;A is not the 
necessity that it has been forsome other players in the industry. We've 
always had a young premiumfleet and rigs that customers prefer. For us, 
it's about if the rightvalue is there and the right deal can be achieved
 and fits in withour fleet and our strategy, we'll do that, but we 
certainly don'tfeel the necessity to do M&amp;A to improve our fleet or 
to improveour composition. I think others are more driven by that 
metric. Forus, it's really about the right opportunity and whether it 
makessense. So we're open to it but not a necessity, I guess, in 
summary.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL WILLIAM URBAN:</b> Okay. Makes sense. And then from a 
marketperspective, historically, you've had a very strong presence in 
bothof the major markets in Latin America and Brazil and Mexico 
andcontinue to. With the political changes there, how do you see 
thelandscape unfolding, especially as it pertains to foreign operators?I
 mean, obviously, Petrobras and Pemex will continue to be active intheir
 respective markets, but are you seeing any caution or hesitancyto move 
forward or maybe at least take a bit of a wait and see ineither or both 
of those markets given the political changes there?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Yes. I mean geopolitics and changing in 
governmentsis obviously something that we look at very intently in 
executing ourbusiness. A pretty business-forward government in Brazil, 
and I thinkthat's good for that future market. The addition of the IOCs 
toBrazil in a large way is certainly going to help drive that market 
inthe absence of Petrobras driving itself. It certainly adds to 
thatmarket. Mexico, we have long-term contracts there. So I think 
we'rejust going to have to see how the administration plays out. And 
thenone thing that is true in Mexico is Pemex needs to replace 
productionand replace reserves. We've had a great relationship with 
Pemex sincewe've been there in the last 7, 8 years, and we expect that 
tocontinue. And we have presence. We have exposure. We have experiencein
 that market. And we look forward to continuing to be active inthat 
market going forward.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from GregLewis of BTIG.</p>
<p><b>GREGORY ROBERT LEWIS, MD, BTIG, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b> I 
guess I'dlike to talk a little bit about how you're thinking about 
capitalallocation. I mean, clearly, the focus seems like it's paying 
downthe new senior secured notes, but on the flip side of that, you 
stillhave -- as you mentioned, you have a lot of rigs -- good rigs 
workingbut you also have a lot of good rigs on the sidelines. And I'm 
justtrying to understand how you've kind of looked down your fleet -- 
ormore on the nonworking rigs, how we should think about some of 
theserigs being reactivated and sort of what types of cost we should 
bethinking about. Any kind of color around that you can provide wouldbe 
super helpful.</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Sure. I'll give you the headline and then 
maybe alittle bit of color behind that. We will not reactivate rigs 
purelyon speculation until the market justifies it. We're comfortable 
withthe rigs we have working. We have significant presence in all 
themajor markets that we're in. We're very focused on keeping 
theutilization on our rigs that we have out and active in the 
marketwhere it is, but part of having the financial flexibility that 
wehave is about having forward capital discipline with where we 
deploythat capital going forward. And it doesn't make sense for us to 
spendsignificant amounts of capital to reactivate rigs on 
speculationwithout any visibility of work or to reactivate rigs and 
bring theminto a market that the cost of bringing the rig back into the 
marketdoesn't justify. So we look at each contract based on its own 
merits,what sort of term, what sort of dayrate, what it's going to cost 
toreactivate the rig, whether an SPS is required, but until we see 
thedayrates or a commercial opportunity that makes sense for us to 
bringa rig back into the market, we are going to err on the side of 
beingcapital disciplined for our cold stacked rigs.</p>
<p><b>GREGORY ROBERT LEWIS:</b> Okay, great. And then just one other one
 forme. During the restructuring process, there were a couple 
jack-upsthat the company decided to part with, sell, get a good price. 
Iguess, since then, we've seen actually more improvement in assetvalues 
for -- I guess, for jack-up rigs at this point, so as we thinkabout 
potential -- you mentioned potential opportunities. Could wealso see 
Seadrill potentially be willing to sell with -- some moreassets as kind 
of we see some improvements in the market to sort ofspeed up the 
deleveraging process?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Well, the one thing we don't do is fall in 
love withour assets. And I will say, well, that's why we don't name them
 aftermembers of management or directors, because that makes them harder
 tosell. And I think you can't do that. So if you look at those 
3jack-ups that we divested, I mean, we have made a core part of 
ourstrategy being a young and premium asset provider. Of those rigs 
thatwe sold, even though our fleet on the whole is young and 
premium,they were on the older end of our jack-up fleet. A couple of 
thoseunits had not worked for a period of time. And it was 
anopportunistic deal for us at the time to divest those assets. 
Iwouldn't read too much into it. We will continue to be opportunisticon 
either the sell side or even on the purchase side where it makessense.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question is from Patrick Fitzgerald of Baird.</p>
<p><b>PATRICK JOHN FITZGERALD, HIGH YIELD DESK ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD&amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b> Are all of your rigswithout contracts cold stacked? Or are any of them warm stacked?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> It depends in what time frame you're looking 
at. Imean the numbers that are in the quarter was at the end of 
thatquarter. So on the jack-up side, we had 1 rig that was warm 
stacked.On the floater side, there were 4. A couple of those rigs, I 
think,you can expect to go back to work. 1 of those rigs, the West 
Eclipse,is currently undergoing the process of having a mooring 
systeminstalled in it. So it's considered warm stacked but it's actually
 inthe yard undergoing an upgrade process. So I think that covers it.Did
 I answer your question?</p>
<p><b>PATRICK JOHN FITZGERALD:</b> Yes, yes. So what are your options with thenewbuild jack-ups at this point?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> So the newbuild jack-ups that we have, it is, I
 willsay, a complicated process, but look, I'd think about it this 
way.Those rigs were contracted in special-purpose vehicles, in 
entitiesthat have direct relationship with the yard. There are no 
parentcompany guarantees back to Seadrill Limited with -- associated 
withthose rigs. So some of them have been delivered or missed 
theirdelivery date, and we're in a discussion with the yard about what 
wedo with them. So we view them as optionality for us. There is no 
--although we carry it in the notes, there is no liability for us backto
 Seadrill Limited other than the initial down payments we made tobuild 
those rigs. And we'll continue the constructive discussions wehave with 
Dalian about how we resolve those rigs going forward. But Iwould view it
 as an option for us, and that's how you can think aboutit.</p>
<p><b>PATRICK JOHN FITZGERALD:</b> Okay. You talked about accelerated 
paymentswith respect to your new 12% secured notes. Those are callable 
in2021. What kind of accelerated payments can you make?</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> Well, just to be clear, the note matures in 2025 
and itcarries interest both PIK and cash. The PIK eventually 
accumulatesand becomes more NSNs, but the redemption mechanisms really 
arethreefold. Obviously, there's a make whole, which obviously isn'tvery
 attractive to us. There is a provision or an equity [floor]effectively 
that allows us through the raising of capital, eitherequity or debt, in 
Seadrill Limited to take off a large part of theNSNs. And then the other
 way in which we can do that is throughmandatory par -- mandatory offers
 from various assets that werepledged to security for the new secured 
notes. And of course, you'veseen that [fill] already in part both with 
the West Rigel proceedsthat we used to redeem $126 million of the new 
secured notes and amandatory offer that we have to make in relation to a
 maturing loanthat was repaid back to us from Sapura Energy. And there 
we have tomake an offer at 103. And obviously, generally that will be 
tenderedfor acceptance if it's below and not if it's above. And at the 
time,it was above. After that, we have an ability to call half of 
thatamount on the NSNs. So there's various mechanisms in which we 
cantake down the NSNs either by realizing cash -- or proceeds, 
heldproceeds, from the sale of pledged assets or through raising 
capitalat Seadrill Limited.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question is from Michael Alsford of Citi.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J ALSFORD, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I'vejust got a couple of specific questions around '19. So could you 
givemaybe a bit of guidance on where you actually see CapEx for the 
groupfor '19, I guess, sort of conscious around sort of what 
maintenancespend will be but also on the other sort of investments 
you'reneeding to make into the fleet? And then just secondly, around 
tax.Clearly, you're sort of not making much in the way of net profit, 
butI'm just wondering whether there is obviously tax to pay as 
you'reheading into '19 sort of on an underlying basis.</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> Well, I mean, we don't break out CapEx as we 
lookforward into each year. And in -- with regard to tax, I mean, 
look,we pay -- our cash taxes are paid where we operate, effectively. 
Andof course, they will move from year to year, depending on where weare
 operational, but -- and of course, it reflects generally wherewe're 
making profit and the basis of which tax is paid. I meansometimes it can
 be deemed profit. Or it can be actual profits and,of course, also 
customs and other taxes that we pay. But I think, atthis stage, trying 
to give you guidance for '19 is pretty difficult.I'm sorry I can't be 
more helpful on that particular question, yes.</p>
<p><b>MICHAEL J ALSFORD:</b> Okay. So maybe if I can ask a follow-up 
then, yes,around sort of rates, and you're obviously talking about sort 
of afirming up of some of the rates versus the harsh environment 
rigs.But I don't know. Can you give us sense as to the direction or 
paceat which you think the rates will recover? Are we sort of 
talkingabout a multiyear recovery? Or should we think about it as a sort
 of,end of '19, that's when you're starting to see some 
reasonabletightness in some of the rigs, some classifications within 
themarket?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Well, I think what we can say and as I said in
 myprepared remarks was we already are starting to see tightening 
inrates. It is difficult to predict, to know, to prognosticate aboutthe 
precise shape of a recovery or generally turn out to be liars. Soall 
right, it's not -- we're reluctant to get into speculation aboutexactly 
the shape of the recovery. What we do know is that thefundamentals are 
there and the signposts are there for a recoveringmarket. If you wind 
back 6 months ago kind of in the benignultra-deepwater market, the 
prevailing rates were, say, closer to 100than they were to 150. And what
 we are already seeing as we saw withthe Carina is, for the right 
specification of units in the rightmarket that a customer wants, that 
the rates are closer to 200 thanthey are to 100. We expect that trends 
to continue through '19.Utilization levels in all the markets are 
picking up. Marketedutilization in across the global fleet is in the 
mid-70s in thefloater side and trending upwards. And if contractors 
remaindisciplined, and consolidation is helping that -- and we're 
certainlygoing to play our part in being disciplined and not 
speculativelyreactivating rigs. And I certainly hear others on their 
conferencecalls saying that they're going to be disciplined in doing 
that. AndI think you can see -- you can expect to see additional 
tightness inthe market. Obviously, it has to do with contractor behavior
 and alsothe continuing need for operators to put the rigs back to work,
 but Ithink -- I don't think it's going to be -- '19 is going to 
continueto be -- given the timing, the lead time between when contracts 
are-- when rigs are contracted, especially on the deepwater side, 
andwhen they actually go to work, '19 is going to be a challenging 
yearfor a lot of people in the market. And we're going to 
remaindisciplined in that, but the dayrates are certainly heading the 
rightdirection. They're already solid in the harsh environment market 
andwe continue to -- we expect that to continue. And there's a kind of 
amore broad-based general recovery in the jack-up market really drivenby
 a significant increase in demand driven from the Middle East.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question is from Renaud Saleur of AnacondaInvestments.</p>
<p><b>RENAUD SALEUR, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ANACONDA PARTNERS, LLC:</b> I 
waswondering when you expect the recovery in the 
ultra-deepwaterdayrates. We've seen that most of your competitors and 
yourselveshave done a significant effort and improvement in OpEx; and 
that theaverage dayrate is probably -- for Transocean, probably for you 
isabout $230,000 a day; that we need to see evidence of a recovery inthe
 current dayrates, especially in ultra-deepwater. Do you thinkit's for 
the first half of '19, second half of '19? And to follow upon this and 
on your debt, which is at a 13% yield to call in 2025, doyou think you 
may be able to generate enough free cash flow by 2021to be in a position
 or not to exercise the call?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> I'll handle the first one because I think it's
 verysimilar to the last caller. We are seeing increasing 
utilizationlevels in ultra-deepwater; rates pushing towards $200,000 a 
day,which is already a significant step-up from where they were 6 
monthsago. I mean we're certainly bidding higher in the second half of 
'19and into '20, significantly higher. And even though given that 
we'rebidding those dayrates, we're still having constructive 
discussionswith customers at those rates. So I think that's the key 
indicationfor us on where the market is going.</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> So I think, just to try and tie out your last 
part ofyour question, Renaud. Obviously, we sort of triangulate around 
3things: where dayrates are going, i.e. the speed of the recovery; 
theability to reactivate rigs and spend upfront costs in order 
togenerate more EBITDA and revenue; and preservation of liquidity 
whilewe wait for the recovery. And that is something we look at 
verycarefully because we know that we have to balance carefully the 
needto bring rigs out at the right time to generate off the 
improvingdayrates, so when dayrates have improved. But as we sit here 
today, Ithink we are comfortable. And of course, against the background 
oflooking at the NSNs, the 12% notes, you're also aware that 
obviously,if we -- we have other ways in which we can retire those 
particularnotes. But affordability versus economics is a trade we look 
at whilewe wait for the recovery, and that's the position that we're 
takingand adopting. And as we sit here today, we are confident with 
thevarious tools that we have at our disposal and other things that 
wecan do, that we should see the recovery before obviously we get to 
--out into the longer grass as it were.</p>
<p><b>RENAUD SALEUR:</b> Just a final one. On harsh environment, you're 
about$300,000 a day. I guess harsh environment was more, in 2014, 
around$700,000 a day. Do you expect to go back somewhere in the 
middle?What extra potential do you see on harsh environment rates?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> I don't want to get to, again, prognosticating
 aboutwhere they could go. I think what we'd say is we're at the bottom 
ofmost markets and coming off heading towards mid-cycle. I think 
theharsh environment market is certainly leading that. And I think 
youneed to look at reinvestment or newbuild economics to look at 
thepotential of where dayrates in any of the markets, including 
harshenvironment, could be going. It's still an expensive proposition 
tobuild a high-specification unit and especially so in the 
harshenvironment. And with continued tightening of demand, ultimately 
andin the long run, dayrates should trends towards 
reinvestmenteconomics.</p>
<p><b>RENAUD SALEUR:</b> Just a final one. You said your average OpEx is$130,000 a day on floaters. Is it $130,000 for harsh environment aswell?</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> $120,000, I think, was our average. And 
obviously,that is an average across the fleet. And there is quite -- 
that's ablended rate across the fleet. I mean it changes by 
jurisdiction,especially the cost differential between Norway where 
you're carryingan extra crew versus other parts of the world, depending 
on how muchcrew, regulation. So north of that in Norway, south of that 
in someother places. So that is the average across [the fleet].</p>
<p><b>RENAUD SALEUR:</b> (inaudible) on harsh environment.</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Well, even harsh environment. U.K. is harshenvironment and is lower than Norway, as is East Coast Canada. So...</p>
<p><b>RENAUD SALEUR:</b> No, no, I understand that, but given that you 
make$300,000 a day on harsh environment, is -- does it mean that you 
maybe at $170,000 operating cash flow already on harsh environment?</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> I mean, look, we're not going to break out 
variousgeographical legs and subcategories of our floater fleet. I 
meanwe're providing an average. And within that, there is a range. And 
Ithink it's fair to say that the harsh environment in Norway is a --at 
the higher end of the spectrum of costs. And harsh environmentgenerally 
is higher, but U.K. and Canada are lower than Norway.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question is from Piotr Ossowicz of IronshieldCapital.</p>
<p><b>PIOTR OSSOWICZ:</b> I understand that it may be a bit too early to
 giveCapEx and tax guidance for 2019, but can you give us a bit more 
coloron where should we expect cash flow and cash position moving in 
Q4regarding CapEx, tax, working capital and the other components?</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> I mean, look, we've given the guidance that we've
 given.I mean I think there's plenty of our competitors that give 
noguidance at all. But it's coming out from someone who's been sort 
ofsilent for a year as we've gone through the restructuring. 
Obviously,the only guidance we're giving is 2 pieces that I've given, 
one onEBITDA and one where we are on G&amp;A for the year or the run 
ratefor the year, but I don't think we're going to be staked out in 
thesun on individual items. There's obviously lots of moving parts. 
Andwe'll guide around certain figures.</p>
<p><b>PIOTR OSSOWICZ:</b> All right, but overall and obviously subject 
to thepartial repayment of the bonds, I mean, should we expect CapEx 
tostay broadly flat from September to December?</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> From September to December...</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE:</b> Yes...</p>
<p><b>PIOTR OSSOWICZ:</b> Yes. (inaudible)...</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> (inaudible) you're talking about Q4.</p>
<p><b>PIOTR OSSOWICZ:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Yes, yes...</p>
<p><b>MARK MORRIS:</b> Yes. It should be broadly flat.</p>
<p><b>ANTON DIBOWITZ:</b> Broadly flat.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> This concludes our question-and-answer session. I 
wouldlike to turn the conference back over to John Roche for any 
closingremarks.</p>
<p><b>JOHN T. ROCHE:</b> Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on ourQ3 Earnings Call. And this concludes our call. Thanks again,everyone.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing
 by. Welcome to the Stone Company third-quarter 2018 earnings conference
 call. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today,
 Monday, November 26, 2018. By now everyone should have access to our 
earnings release. It can be found at www.stone.co on the Investor 
Relations section.</p>
<p> Throughout this conference call the Company will be presenting 
non-IFRS financial information including adjusted net income. These are 
important financial measures for the Company, but are not financial 
measures as defined by IFRS. Reconciliations of our non-IFRS financial 
information to the IFRS financial information appear in today's press 
release.</p>
<p> Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I would like to remind 
everyone that today's discussion will include forward-looking 
statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of 
future performance and therefore you should not put undue reliance on 
them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our 
expectations. Please refer to the forward-looking statements disclosure 
in the Company's earnings press release.</p>
<p> In addition, many of the risks regarding our business are disclosed 
in the Company's final prospect for our initial public offering filed on
 Form 424-B4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is 
available at www.SEC.gov. I would now like to turn the conference over 
to your host, Rafael Martins, Investor Relations Executive Officer at 
Stone. Please proceed.</p>
<p> RAFAEL MARTINS, IR EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STONECO LTD.: Good evening, 
everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today I have here with me 
Thiago Piau, our CEO; Marcelo Baldin, VP of Finance; and Lia Matos, 
Chief Strategy Officer. Before I comment on the third-quarter 2018 
results I would like to turn the call over to Thiago. Thiago?</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU, CEO, STONECO LTD.: Thank you, Rafael, and good evening,
 everyone. Thanks for joining us for the third-quarter earnings call and
 our first call as a public company. We look forward to getting to know 
all of you. I also want to thank our clients for their support, the 
entire Stone team for their tremendous work throughout the years, and 
now investors who have backed us throughout this journey that led us to a
 new chapter as a publicly traded company.</p>
<p> We are clearly excited about the opportunities available to us to 
continue to expand our business, offer more solutions to merchants and 
give long-term shareholder value. We are pleased to report strong 
third-quarter 2018 financial and operating results which reflect our 
commitment on executing our growth strategy and our 100% focus on our 
clients' needs.</p>
<p> Our active client base reached over 230,000 in the quarter, 
representing a 127% growth year-over-year. Also we generated total 
revenue and income of BRL440 million in the third quarter, up 121% 
year-over-year. We achieved adjusted net income of BRL89.3 million that 
represents a 21.6% adjusted net margin, almost 19 percentage point 
improvement versus the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> Since this is our first call, I thought it would be helpful to 
reinforce some of our key business points. We empower merchants to 
conduct electronic commerce seamlessly across multiple channels and help
 them grow their business over time through technology. Our mission has 
and will always be to help our clients grow providing superior value 
proposition and the best customer experience.</p>
<p> In order to do that we have developed a deep client centric culture 
and an end-to-end proprietary technology platform that enables us to 
offer great solutions, offer superior value proposition and the best 
experience to our clients has brought the Company where it is today and 
this is reflected in our best-in-class Net Promoter Score.</p>
<p> We've created a disruptive go-to-market approach [business strategy]
 that has enabled us to rapidly grow our client base in only four years 
since the launch of our services. We plan to grow our business by 
leveraging our culture of technology and innovation, to create new 
solutions that empower our clients to grow and manage their business 
more effectively.</p>
<p> Our main target are the 8 million plus SMBs in Brazil and, with over
 230,000 active clients in the quarter, we have a few growth 
opportunities. We will continue to strengthen our relationship with our 
clients through our local operations being at the doorsteps whenever 
they need.</p>
<p> Now I would like to provide you with some other more recent updates,
 including the competitive environment. In a dynamic industry like ours 
the ability to recruit, develop and retain talented people is critical 
to our success and growth. We are currently running our semiannual 
recruitment campaign called Recruta Stone.</p>
<p> For those of you who are not familiar with this campaign, it's one 
of the biggest recruitment processes in the country and also one of the 
main [country] events at the Company. The three main goals of the 
programs are: first, hire motivated and talented entrepreneurs with high
 potential; second, train our leaders in our culture and high practices;
 and finally, improve our brand as an employer. We have had nearly 
30,000 applicants for the process this semester.</p>
<p> Regarding our commitment of providing new solutions to our clients, 
we have to continue positive traction on our reconciliation platform, 
Equals, as well as our foodservice ERP and POS software, Linked Gourmet,
 both of which are still in the early beginnings.</p>
<p> Also, we have seen discussions in the market regarding the 
competitive environment and we believe it is important to share some 
thoughts with you regarding how we frame this topic. The Company will 
always have a humble approach to listen to different opinions and ideas 
in order to learn as much as we can about the competitive landscape.</p>
<p> The SMB market in Brazil is very competitive and it has been facing 
competition with incumbents since day one. We were born in a constantly 
changing environment and we have a very dynamic organization. We believe
 we have the right team, culture, technology and innovation capability 
not only to adapt to market changes but to drive those changes ourselves
 as we have been doing since our foundation.</p>
<p> We believe competition is positive for the market, especially for 
those who matter the most, the merchants. The Brazilian regulators and 
antitrust authority have been successfully fostering competition and 
innovation in the country. This has allowed the influx in the market of 
players like ourselves that are setting higher standards and better 
prices for the merchants.</p>
<p> We are very happy to have contributed to market changes that have 
improved the ability of our clients to grow and manage their business 
more effectively over time. We will always monitor competition very 
closely. However, our commitment towards the client, our actions as 
driven by client needs and our priorities will be to keep listening to 
them so we can provide them with a superior value proposition.</p>
<p> Having that said, I would like to say a few words on price. Our 
clients get superior products and service for a competitive price as we 
look at prices on a takeaway basis because it reflects the monetization 
of additional products and services we offer to them. Also, because we 
may have different combination of rate for each of our products 
depending on the client needs and competitive dynamic in each region.</p>
<p> Regarding competitors trying to take our clients by pricing the 
lowest, we have already been seeing this with more emphasis since the 
beginning of the year. However, we have been able to show our clients 
that the difference in dollar amount is not worth the much poorer 
customer experience and support the incumbents offer.</p>
<p> We know for a long time how to react to players who rely on price to
 compete. Also important to note that we manage our pricing strategy in 
terms of lifetime value of the client. So whatever we believe our price 
is not optimal either up or down, we may adjust in order to increase 
lifetime value.</p>
<p> Our performance so far in the fourth quarter 2018 in terms of 
growth, operational leverage, profitability, take rate, churn rate and 
productivity KPI has been very strong and on track. The Company's 
strategy of having the best customer experience is disciplined execution
 and indeed very close to the client has been paying off.</p>
<p> Looking to the balance of 2018 and beyond, we are excited about the 
opportunities available to us to continue to expand our business, offer 
more solutions to merchants and build long-term shareholder value.</p>
<p> Now I will turn the call back to Rafael so he can provide a 
high-level overview of our financial results for the quarter. Rafael?</p>
<p> RAFAEL MARTINS: Thank you, Thiago. As Thiago said, our third-quarter
 was a great quarter for the Company and the results are indicative of 
our commitment and focus on creating long-term value for all 
stakeholders.</p>
<p> Total revenue and income increased by 121% to BRL440 million in the 
third quarter of 2018 compared to BRL187 million in the third quarter of
 2017. This was mainly driven by a year-over-year increase of 187% 
growth in net revenue from transaction activities and other services, a 
124% increase in net revenue from subscription services and equipment 
rental, and a 108% increase year-over-year in financial income.</p>
<p> Cost of services was BRL81 million for the third quarter 2018, an 
increase of BRL27 million or 50% from BRL54 million in the third quarter
 of 2017. Cost of services as a percentage of total revenue and income 
was 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018, an efficiency gain of 9.2 
percentage points from 28.7% in the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> This efficiency gain was primarily due to a reduction of transaction
 and client service costs as a percentage of total revenue and income by
 6.3 percentage points from 16% in the third quarter of 2017 to 9.7% in 
the third quarter of 2018, and a reduction in other services costs such 
as personnel costs and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of 
total revenue and income by 2.9 percentage points from 12.7% in the 
third quarter of 2017 to 9.8% in the third quarter of 2018.</p>
<p> The reduction of transaction costs as a percentage of total revenue 
and income was primarily driven by dilution the fixed costs of our 
proprietary processing, migration of clients from Elavon Inc. platform 
and efficiency gains.</p>
<p> Administrative expenses increased 45% year-over-year for the third 
quarter of 2018 to BRL62 million. The increase in administrative 
expenses is primarily attributed to growth in headcount, third-party 
services and facilities costs to support our growth and preparation to 
become a public company in addition to higher depreciation expenses.</p>
<p> Selling expenses increased by 104% reaching BRL50 million in the 
third quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase of
 BRL21 million from additional headcount in our sales team in line with 
our strategy to grow through the development of Hubs.</p>
<p> Financial expenses were BRL83 million, an increase of BRL27 million 
from BRL57 million in the third quarter of 2017. This was mainly driven 
by an increase in cost of funding of BRL31 million due to higher 
prepayment volumes, partially offset by a decrease in Brazilian interest
 rates and better funding cost efficiency.</p>
<p> Net income was BRL90.4 million for the third quarter of 2018 
compared to a net loss of BRL14.8 million for the third quarter of 2017.
 In connection with our earnings release we are disclosing adjusted net 
income, a non-IFRS measure, which we believe is an important metric to 
evaluate the operating performance of the Company.</p>
<p> Adjusted net income was BRL89.3 million in the third quarter 2018 
compared to BRL5.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. The main 
factors that contributed to the growth in adjusted net income were: 
increase of our total revenue and income primarily due to higher TPV and
 our focus on growing our base of SMB merchants; improvement in 
financial efficiency reflected by the reduction in financial expenses as
 a percentage of financial income; and operational leverage which 
resulted in a reduction in cost of services, administrative and selling 
expenses as a percentage of total revenue and income.</p>
<p> Besides the results of the third quarter I would like to update you 
on some recent developments. On September 4, 2018, the Company exercised
 an option to purchase the control of equals and upon consummation of 
our initial public offering, in October the Company acquired the 
remaining 44% stake it did not own, resulting in 100% ownership of the 
Company.</p>
<p> On October 24, 2018 we priced our initial public offering of 50.7 
million Class A shares at a public offering price of $24 per share. 
Stone issued and sold 45.8 million Class A common shares and certain 
selling shareholders sold an additional 4.9 million Class A common 
shares.</p>
<p> The underwriters fully exercised their 30-day option to purchase 
additional 7.6 million Class A shares from certain selling shareholders 
at the initial public offering price less the underwriting discount. We 
issued 4.2 million Class A common shares to Ant Financial for $100 
million with the placement closing on November 21, 2018.</p>
<p> Before turning the call up to questions I would like to highlight 
some important aspects about the way we look at our balance sheet and 
our ability to generate cash. So first I will give you a background on 
the way we look at our net cash position.</p>
<p> In the Brazilian market accounts receivable from card issuers are 
usually easily exchangeable for cash through the sale of such 
receivables to financial institutions at a discount. For that reason, 
whenever we sell a receivable to a financial institution our cash 
position increases and our receivables on balance sheet decreases.</p>
<p> That operation by itself does not mean that our business is 
generating cash, but rather that we have taken a funding decision and 
are exchanging a liquid asset for another even more liquid which is 
cash. We could opt for other funding sources such as raising debt 
(inaudible) or raising equity instead of selling the receivables.</p>
<p> On the other hand, whenever we stop selling receivables our cash 
position tends to decrease in the short term and our receivables on 
balance sheet tend to increase as our operations grow. This wouldn't 
mean that our ability to generate cash deteriorated, but rather that we 
have chosen a different working capital financing option.</p>
<p> Given this dynamic we look internally at what we call net liquidity 
in our balance sheet. This is equivalent to traditional net cash metric,
 but factoring in our position of both receivables from card issuers and
 payable to clients. So net liquidity would be the sum of cash and cash 
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivables from card 
issuers excluding for value adjustments minus accounts payables to 
clients, loans and financing, and obligations to FIDC senior quota 
holders.</p>
<p> Whenever our net liquidity improves it's strictly now effect from 
equity events such as capital increase, share repurchase and 
acquisitions. We can see that we have the ability to generate positive 
cash flow. With that said, operator, we will open the call up to 
questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Felipe Salomao, Citibank.</p>
<p> FELIPE SALOMAO, ANALYST, CITIBANK: I had one follow-up question 
about competition. And first of all, thanks, Thiago, for sharing your 
thoughts on that topic. Basically one of your largest competitors 
changed the speech regarding its pricing strategy. And now they are 
willing to quantify this (inaudible) up to 30% in order to prevent 
further market share losses.</p>
<p> How this shift has impacted (inaudible) some expectation for top- 
and bottom-line growth compared to a month ago during the management 
road show? I just need to get a color on how you guys are expecting 
competition to change the speech (inaudible) change the strategy. Now if
 you could share some thoughts on that that would be fantastic. Thanks.</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: Thank you for your question. Let me tell you how we 
frame this competitive dynamic here in the Company. So first is 
important to notice that we face competition since day one. And in the 
early beginnings we just had the licenses from Visa and MasterCard to 
offer in our payment solution.</p>
<p> So we created a lot of depreciation in terms of better value 
proposition with customer service, technology and distribution to our 
clients, but we still had to price below incumbents until the second 
half of 2017 when we started to price head to head with incumbents.</p>
<p> So the first quarter this year, first-quarter 2018 (inaudible), we 
started to see that incumbents started to price below us in many cases. 
But we have been growing in the previous three quarters despite that. So
 I think that the main message here is that these kind of recent 
discussions are not new to us. We are used to this kind of environment 
for more than a year.</p>
<p> In terms of pricing strategy, we remain focused on lifetime value. 
So our goal here is to increase lifetime value over time. And we have 
the ability to show our clients that in the dollar amount it's not worth
 it to accept a much poorer customer service and support for 5% to 10% 
discount is what we have seen from the incumbent.</p>
<p> So if we take into account a client that does on average BRL35,000 
in sales per month with around the 2% take rate, so 5% to 10% discount 
should be around $10 to $20. So we don't think that it's worth it for 
our clients to sometimes wait almost an hour in the line and not having 
somebody at the doorstep whenever they have a problem.</p>
<p> So we really believe that our differentiation in terms of value 
proposition is much stronger than the kind of pricing dynamic that 
incumbents have tried to provide.</p>
<p> And regarding fourth quarter, I can tell you that we have very 
strong results. We are on track with our planning both in growth metrics
 as productivity and take rates and churn. When we look to those metrics
 in the fourth quarter so far we have [bettered] this quarter than in 
the third quarter results.</p>
<p> So we are very confident about our ability to continue to expand our
 business and offer value propositions which are very superior to our 
clients. And over time we want to provide much more software and 
financial products that will help those clients grow. So we are not 
seeing any kind of difference in the fields regarding the metrics. We 
are on track with our plans and with very strong results for fourth 
quarter. Do you want to add something, Rafael?</p>
<p> RAFAEL MARTINS: Yes, Felipe. Rafael here, just to add to what Thiago
 said. You mentioned regarding what we said in the road show of our IPO 
one month ago. So by that time we already forecasted a lot of 
competition. And what we have seen now is no different than what we 
expected. So this is very important to highlight. That's why we have 
seen results strong and on track with our own expectations.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Eduardo Rosman, BTG.</p>
<p> EDUARDO ROSMAN, ANALYST, BTG: Also I have a question here on 
competition. As you know, some of your incumbents, they have been more 
vocal about calling the sector a commodity. Pretty much saying that it's
 all about prices, that it's not worth having good service. So I want to
 know your take on that.</p>
<p> One of your competitors that sells information for instance, the 
competitor says, look, it's very hard to sell that kind of information 
to the SME because the average Brazilian can't read the charts. So my 
question is how to convince the client that he needs help in managing 
that business. And why do you believe that you can make different than 
incumbents? That's my question. Thanks.</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: I think that regarding the way that we explain how we 
differentiate ourselves to our clients is that we learned that helping 
them to manage their cash flow, being very fair about the rate and very 
transparent to show them how much they are paying for -- and being very 
close to them to listen to their needs and provide more solutions to 
them is the best way to establish this relationship of trust in which we
 can provide more products over time.</p>
<p> So as we said during the IPO process, we started with the payments 
which is the main pain point of the client. And keep in mind that mostly
 inside of Brazil they are not used to the kind of service level that we
 offer to them. And once we start to explain then how they have to 
manage their working capital better and all the fees that they pay, we 
can move and provide much more solutions as we are doing nowadays with 
the reconciliation with the POS solutions.</p>
<p> So I think that we are mainly focused here on providing the best 
customer service and support, the best solutions to our clients. And we 
see that whenever our clients experiment (sic - experience) this kind of
 service and our solutions we can have better yields in terms of our 
solutions and that's what creates more lifetime value. So we drive 
lifetime value both creating more stickiness and creating more yield as 
we put more products in the same clients over time.</p>
<p> So, I do think that it's all about being close to the clients, 
offering the best value proposition, being very focused on their needs 
and provide all the solutions that they need to manage and grow the 
business over time. So I think that the client centric culture that we 
have developed, it's the most important thing for us and we will keep 
this kind of mentality as we grow as a company.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Carlos Macedo, Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p> CARLOS MACEDO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: I had one question. Piau and I
 think also Rafael mentioned that with Cielo becoming a lot more 
aggressive now we see Safra Pay basically giving the POS terminal away, 
charging no rent, no fee. The competition is escalating and one of the 
things you have to do to retain your clients is to increase the 
switching costs and doing so with software and I think, Thiago, you 
mentioned that before.</p>
<p> What is the pipeline for the rollout of more software solutions that
 would increase stickiness? Is the digital account upcoming, is that 
something you guys expect to roll out in the next few months. Outside of
 Linked Gourmet and Equals is something else coming that we can pinpoint
 that would help you reduce the churn even more than you already have 
particularly as the competition escalates? Thanks.</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: I think that to address that, first I would say that 
when you look to churn rates we are better in November than October. So 
in fourth quarter actually we are better than the third quarter and 
that's very encouraging results for that regarding these competitive 
dynamics.</p>
<p> And regarding the roadmap of solutions, more than the 
reconciliation, the POS that we currently have, we are looking for new 
verticals in which we can invest in more POS and ERP solutions over 
time. In the solutions that we are developing in-house, yes, the banking
 solutions is something that we really believe will be a huge 
opportunity for us.</p>
<p> And we have decided to create the whole platform from scratch as we 
did in payments in order to control the experience of our clients and 
adapt solutions to the process of our clients. And we think that we have
 opportunity doing lending in the future in the medium-term using our 
relationship with the clients to generate opportunity for third parties 
to offer solutions to our clients.</p>
<p> So when you think about lending, and we've seen that some different 
players in the marketplace are already doing, we do not think of using 
our balance sheet but using the relationship that we have and 
third-party capital to provide those solutions to the merchants.</p>
<p> So that is the kind of roadmap that we have and we are still looking
 for new POS solutions for our clients. So we decided to create our own 
operational system from the beginning. We were the first mover on that. 
And we think that we have a lot to capture in the near future providing 
solutions integrated with the operational system that we did.</p>
<p> CARLOS MACEDO: Can you provide a time table for the launch of these 
things even if it's just within the next 12 months or the next 24 months
 or the next 36 months?</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: So, we are planning to have a relevant evolution regarding the bank and the lending opportunity in the next year.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Lucas Lopes, Credit Suisse.</p>
<p> LUCAS LOPES, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: I have two, if not a problem. 
First of all our [elections set a bit on] the team of competition. I do 
understand that customer experience matters and the retention of new 
clients. But for new ones, I used to gain clients with more expensive 
price, let's say with -- by being more -- 5%, 10%, 15% more expensive 
than income is on average. Do you think that you can deliver your 
business plan? I know that the [GAAP] is not there yet, not 5%, 10%, 
15%. But I mean the [speech] of the incumbent indicate they are able to 
lower price as much as needed.</p>
<p> And my second question, if I may, on the franchise model. In the 
second quarter in a row you only had four franchises, but if you go to 
your website you do say that the Company or the execution of 
(inaudible), there is the potential to open up to 200 franchises in the 
long term. And I understand that the model is quite new.</p>
<p> I was curious to see how the evolution has been. Could you share -- I
 mean the level of (inaudible) of potential new franchisees? And if you 
can see the number of franchises going from 4 to 50, 100 perhaps in a 
short period of time? And again thanks. That's my two questions. Thanks 
for taking them.</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: So first regarding our ability to and commitment with 
our business plan. Yes, we have seen very strong results in terms of 
growth and we don't think these price dynamics are going to impact the 
productivity and the ability to win new clients. Actually as we said, we
 are already seeing this kind of movement that incumbents are trying to 
price below us since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p> And you can see that we are adding clients very fast by that. And I 
can assure that in the fourth quarter we had very strong results in 
terms of traction and productivity with the same level of take rates. 
And we think that we can have better take rates over time mainly because
 of the value proposition that we offer.</p>
<p> So, we are 100% committed with our business plan. Actually we can 
see we are a little bit ahead of what we had planned before. So very 
encouraging results and very confident with the work that the team is 
doing here in terms of execution. I think that having this very focused 
and disciplined execution is really paying off and the most important 
thing to us is to keep our minds in our clients, so that's the first 
thing.</p>
<p> Regarding the franchise model, we are still in the beginnings of 
that. We don't have any update. So we have a huge opportunity in terms 
of the Hubs in Brazil. We are seeing positive trends in terms of 
entrepreneurs that want to know more about the franchisee model.</p>
<p> So, we are really in the early beginnings of that. I don't have any 
relevant comments regarding that. But I think that's revenue growth that
 we can use over time, but we are mainly focused on the opening up of 
the new Hubs and drive market share in the current Hubs that we have.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Domingos Falavina, JPMorgan.</p>
<p> DOMINGOS FALAVINA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Also two quick questions. The 
first one is actually more of an accounting question. If we go through 
your IFRS reconciliation on page 6 of your press release, it seems there
 are like five basic items you are adjusting in there and there is only 
one that's not present in 2017 in the first three months.</p>
<p> So by exclusion I am assuming the tax effects are in relation to the
 gain on the equals. However, the gain on the equals is negative, so you
 are adjusting negative, but then you basically remove again the tax 
effect. My question here is to what does the 7.3 million refer to? And 
if it is related to the 21.4 shouldn't it be a positive sign instead of a
 negative?</p>
<p> And the second question, if I may, is I read your release and on the
 qualitative side it seems you are trying to convey a message to the 
market that competition is not -- shouldn't be a reason for alarm, at 
least not as far as you can see the 4Q. I would like to get some more 
quantitative data. So basically when you look year on year the first two
 months with November almost ending, are volumes striking growth year on
 year in line with the secure -- the accelerating versus the third Q, 
are they decelerating versus the third Q?</p>
<p> THIAGO PIAU: So I think I will start here with the last question 
regarding some color on numbers of the fourth quarter. So we have 
decided to provide you guys with some guidance in the 2018 full-year 
adjusted net income. So the range that we are providing here is 313 to 
330 adjusted net income for full-year 2018.</p>
<p> So we decided to provide this guidance because we are very 
comfortable with the execution and we received some feedback that would 
be great to our shareholder base to provide some color in the results of
 the full year. So given that said, I will move here to Rafael to 
explain a little bit the IFRS reconciliation.</p>
<p> RAFAEL MARTINS: Hi, Domingos; Rafael here. We can get also off-line 
then afterwards if you have any more follow-ups. But basically this 
difference in tax and the adjustment is basically deductibility of our 
base expenses that change a little bit over the quarters. So that's why 
you have that effect of the tax.</p>
<p> But just to remind that when there is a gain we put it as a 
negative, right, to adjust for the gain, so we take the gain out. And in
 case of share-based it is an expense, so we adjusted positively, so you
 add it to the adjusted net income.</p>
<p> DOMINGOS FALAVINA: And in 2017 basically there was a different kind of share compensation that did not create any tax shield?</p>
<p> RAFAEL MARTINS: Yes, we have -- in 2017 we had different types of 
share-based compensation. Basically one is equity classified, another 
one is liability classified. And then we have different tax treatments 
for each one of them. And if you want we can get in more details 
regarding its trench and how they are treated in terms of tax and that's
 why you see that difference.</p>

questions left in the queue, this does conclude today's teleconference.

<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you for standing by. This is the conference 
operator.Welcome to the Sangoma Technologies Fiscal 2019 Q1 Investor 
Call.(Operator Instructions) And the conference is being 
recorded.(Operator Instructions)</p>
<p>I would now like to turn the conference over to David Moore, ChiefFinancial Officer. Please go ahead, Mr. Moore.</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE, CFO, SANGOMA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION:</b> Thank 
you,operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Sangoma's first 
investmentcall of fiscal 2019. We are recording the call, and we'll make
 itavailable on our website for anyone who is unable to join us live.I'm
 here today together with Bill Wignall, Sangoma's President andCEO, to 
take you through the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019,which started
 on July 1 of this year. We will discuss the pressrelease that was 
distributed over the wire services on November 22,together with the 
company's interim unaudited financial statementsand Q1 MD&amp;A, which 
are available on both SEDAR and our website atwww.sangoma.com.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Sangoma reports under International FinancialReporting
 Standards, IFRS, and during the call, we may refer to acouple of terms 
such as operating income, EBITDA, and adjusted cashflow, that are not 
IFRS measures, but which are defined in ourMD&amp;A. Please also note 
that unless otherwise stated, allreferences to dollars are to the 
Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the statements 
madeduring the course of this call that are not purely historical 
areforward-looking statements regarding the company, on 
management'sintentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations and strategies for 
thefuture. Because such statements deal with future events, they 
aresubject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results 
mightdiffer materially from those projected in those 
forward-lookingstatements. Important factors that could cause actual 
results todiffer materially are discussed in the accompanying MD&amp;A 
and inthe company's annual audited financial statements.</p>
<p>With that, I would like to introduce our President and CEO, BillWignall.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, SANGOMATECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION:</b>
 Thanks, David. Welcome, everyone, and thankyou for joining us today. My
 prepared remarks will fall into 4categories. I will start by covering 
our first quarter results; next,I will share a few comments on balance 
sheet and cash flow; thirdly,I'll provide an update on how the Digium 
integration is proceeding;and finally, I'll wrap up with a comment on 
forward guidance.</p>
<p>You'll note that I did not mention an update on strategy for 
today'scall. I covered this extensively only 4 weeks ago, so may I 
pleasesuggest that any of you who are new to Sangoma might listen to 
thatrecording to get a detailed picture of our business since all of 
thatmaterial is still current.</p>
<p>As always, I'll then offer a short summary before turning the 
callback to David for questions. Before jumping in, just a reminder 
thatthis quarter's results include 1 month of the most recently 
completedacquisition of Digium, which closed in September, and a full 
quarterof CCD, which we acquired in January, both of which contributed 
tothe increase in scale.</p>
<p>Okay. Let's now turn to Q1 results. Our first quarter of fiscal 
'19ending on September 30 was another record and the 15th quarter in 
arow where we've delivered more revenue than from the same quarter inthe
 preceding year. Sales were $21.4 million, 81% higher than thesame 
quarter last year and a 22% jump from the immediately precedingfourth 
quarter of fiscal '18. This increase came from the ongoingintrinsic 
growth at Sangoma, the compounding of recurring servicesrevenue, and the
 addition of CCD and Digium.</p>
<p>Gross profit was $12.4 million in the first quarter at a gross 
marginof 58%. Gross margin percentage is expected to increase slightly 
infuture quarters when Digium higher margins will be included for 
theentire 3-month period. Operating expenses were $10.6 million in 
thefirst quarter of fiscal '19, about double those of the prior 
year,primarily as a result of the 2 acquisitions mentioned above.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, EBITDA of $2.5 million is more than doublethat
 of the same period in fiscal '18 and even a little stronger thanwe had 
anticipated.</p>
<p>And lastly, below the EBITDA line, you will observe onetime 
expenseswe did incur related to the Digium acquisition, and this covered
 allof the standard types of costs you would anticipate such as 
legalfees, investment banking fees, quality of earnings report, reps 
andwarranty insurance, rendered due diligence and other 
associatedtransaction costs. All of this was provided for in the quarter
 andtotaled approximately $2.1 million. Because of the onetime 
$2.1million cost just mentioned, there is a net loss in the first 
quarterof about $1 million compared to net income of $0.4 million in 
fiscal'18.</p>
<p>In summary, we're very pleased with what was a strong $2.5 
millionEBITDA for the quarter, and a little higher than we expected, all
 avery encouraging start to the year. But before moving to the 
balancesheet, I would like to share a short comment on net income, given
 wehad a couple of questions on this during our last call. There are 
2specific items I'd like to discuss, tax rate and amortization, and 
Ihope you'll bear with me through this accounting discussion.</p>
<p>Let's start with tax. At Sangoma, although we're still a micro 
capcompany, tax is not simple because we're managing taxation 
acrossmultiple legal entities and multiple tax jurisdictions in 
multiplecurrencies, what's read here in Canada, but not in others, et 
cetera,et cetera. Sangoma carefully considers how we structure our 
businessto conserve resources, rather than minimize a tax line on the 
P&amp;Lstatement. Also, to further complicate matters, as many of you 
know,tax laws and rates are being changed in multiple countries 
thesedays.</p>
<p>With that as a backdrop, and at this point in time, if you're 
tryingto figure out what tax rate to assume for Sangoma, or if you're 
ananalyst constructing and updating a detailed financial model, 
werecommend using a tax rate at about 25% of EBT. As you'll hear in 
amoment, there is tax planning work going on in realtime now, andwe'll 
update you if we see that changing materially.</p>
<p>To help understand this recommendation a little bit better, we 
couldlook back on fiscal '18 for comparison and illustration purposes. 
Forexample, our P&amp;L had about $4 million of pretax profit that 
year.We expensed $1.5 million in taxes, made up of $1 million in 
currenttaxes and $0.5 million in deferred taxes. This is a rate of 
around35%. On the cash flow statement, you will see that 
theoreticalcalculation is replaced by the actual cash amounts paid. Last
 year,we paid $0.3 million in tax, and we refunded $0.2 million. So on 
a$57 million business earning $4 million in profit before tax, 
weactually paid $0.1 million out. And in some prior years, we 
wereactually net recipients of tax. So you see that this 35% tax rate 
onthe P&amp;L differs materially from the tax actually paid out.</p>
<p>Okay, the second item that I'd said that I would comment on in 
thisaccounting section is amortization, or more specifically, that 
ofintangible assets amortization. Intangible assets are an 
importantfactor in tech company acquisitions. Valuation and purchase 
priceallocation for such acquisitions is then determined by a 
specializedoutside party. That data and an analysis of the useful life 
of thoseintangible assets helps calculate the amortization. Each 
businessacquired has a different set of criteria, and so each is 
consideredindividually. As a theoretical example, if the life is 
estimated as10 years in one sample case on $12 million of intangible 
assetsacquired, it would lead to $1.2 million of amortization per year 
or$0.1 million per month.</p>
<p>For Q1 of fiscal '19, we've used an estimate for the 
Digiumacquisition because we're doing that accounting and valuation work
 inQ2. This estimate will change once the valuation is complete. As 
partof that Q2 work, we'll be completing an audit of the 
transactionhaving the full purchase price allocation determined by 
anindependent valuer and locking down the transaction values in the 
Q2accounts. David is specifically doing this right away so that we donot
 have significant Q4 adjustments later, when the auditors reviewthe 
valuation report. For the same reason we will have the taxstructure 
analyzed, so the potential value of the Digium netoperating losses can 
be considered, including the projected timing oftheir utilization.</p>
<p>Okay. So that many of you are thoroughly bored with that 
accountingdiscussion of tax and amortization, let's turn to the balance 
sheetas of the end of Q1. Before commenting on specific individual 
lines,I'd like to briefly recap the financing of the Digium 
acquisition,given its impact on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>You may recall that we raised $12 million of equity through a 
privateplacement in March, and $21 million of new debt through our 
existingbanker in September. Further, we issued about 4 million shares 
toDigium shareholders as part of the consideration to buy the company.As
 a result, there would be these significant changes this quarter,all of 
which were totally foreseen.</p>
<p>As of September 30, Sangoma finished the quarter with a cash 
balanceof $5 million and had total debt of approximately $25 
millioncompletely consistent with what was expected when the Digium deal
 wasannounced. Accounts receivable increased from $7.2 million 
lastquarter to $10.8 million as of the end of Q1, and inventory grew 
fromjust under $7 million to just over $10 million. All of this 
isdirectly attributable to the Digium transaction entirely as 
expected,and some of it will be timing, since Digium tends to have 
strongersales in the last month of each quarter, and we took over in 
earlySeptember.</p>
<p>At a $100 million run rate, there can be significantly larger 
swingsbetween quarters on any such line item as I previously mentioned 
inprior calls. For example, we now move container-loads of phonesrather 
than pallets, a perfectly normal operational event.</p>
<p>And next, I'd like to comment on cash flow just briefly. Thisquarter,
 adjusted cash flow from operations was about $1.7 million,excluding the
 one-time costs associated with the acquisition. Overtime, we generally 
expect EBITDA to be the best proxy for adjustedcash flow.</p>
<p>And finally, just a quick point of reassurance. Sangoma was, 
ofcourse, perfectly and comfortably on side with all the debt 
covenantsof the new loan taken on to help finance the Digium 
transaction.</p>
<p>With that, I'll bring my remarks on our financials to a close andturn
 to an update on the Digium integration. Perhaps I'll start witha short 
reminder of the company we're merging into Sangoma. Digium isa true 
pioneer in the communications market, having launched the opensource 
segment with Asterisk, and is a very well-respected player inour 
industry. They commenced with the transition to cloud and theirrecurring
 revenue model about 4 or 5 years ago in advance of Sangoma,and that has
 been very successful, with Digium now generating about40% of their 
sales from recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Indeed, over 40% of their new UC customers choose Digium's 
cloudservice as opposed to an on-premise option, and they're growing 
thisvery profitable segment nicely. Although we share some similarity 
inparts of our product portfolio, interestingly, there's not a lot 
ofoverlapping customers in our channels.</p>
<p>So let's start the update on this topic of integration with 
people,given our company is an intellectual capital business. Firstly, 
itfeels really good as we've gotten to know the Digium team and seenthe 
energy and contribution they have to make. We are well into 
theintegration of teams, departments and organization structure. 
Thereremains more to do in this area, and I expect most of that to 
becompleted by the end of Q2.</p>
<p>There is much work taking place to bring formerly disparate folks 
togather into one company with one identity, but we're making reallygood
 progress. One modest example might be the amalgamation of whatwas 4 
separate employee benefit programs now being brought togetherinto one 
cohesive plan, something that's actually very complex in theU.S. 
minefield of employee health and medical care.</p>
<p>As of 2 weeks ago, we now have approximately 200 staff in the U.S. 
ona single benefits program. That generates savings for the 
company,offers better care to our valued staff, and helps provide 
commonalityfor managers who have global teams on a single plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps slightly less interesting, but equally essential forexecution
 and efficiency, Sangoma is now working our way through keydecisions on 
IT and operational systems. We have already harmonizedcommunications 
tools such that all staff are on a connected phonesystem and we now have
 standardized desktop software, e-mail, etcetera, on G suites from what 
was a mixture of tools. Sangoma hasmade progress on selecting our 
preferred CRM and marketing automationtools, and is in the process of 
planning those transitions, too. Iknow that internal IT stuff is not 
sexy, but it is important to ourability to operate as one company so, 
while I might sound a littleboring to investors, I wanted to touch on it
 just slightly.</p>
<p>Timing and implementing the cost synergies is also well underway. 
InQ1, we already negotiated and obtained better pricing to reduce 
ourcosts from several key suppliers by offering amalgamated volumes 
andintegrated lines. A couple of examples might include, for 
instance,our cloud network infrastructure costs or our manufacturers 
ofphones. This process is ongoing, and I would expect the majority ofthe
 decisions enabling these synergies to be completed in Q2. And byQ3, we 
will see a more cost-efficient level of OpEx, as I 
previouslycommunicated.</p>
<p>As you would expect, we're right in the middle of reengineering 
oursupply chain, the sourcing for manufacturers, the logistics, 
thewarehousing, et cetera, and there is work being done to optimize 
ourdata centers and to remove duplication in marketing spend, and all 
ofthese things take a little longer to plan, but are well underway 
andwill bring up the Digium operating margins for Q3.</p>
<p>The last topic on the Digium integration section I thought I'd 
covertoday deals with customer-facing subjects. We are also in the 
processof beginning to integrate our sales teams and channel structure. 
Thisis being done first outside of North America where it is a bit 
morestraightforward, given that Digium did not have staff nor 
officesaround the world like Sangoma did. So managing customers, sales 
andchannels in the rest of the world is being transitioned to theSangoma
 folks and departments that already had operational capabilityin those 
regions.</p>
<p>This gives us better coverage of such channels and customers 
aroundthe world, and I would say that the very initial feedback that 
Ipersonally have heard from such organizations has been entirelypositive
 as you might expect, when they find out that there are nowSangoma folks
 close to them, often in their own countries, who speaktheir own 
languages. Working out how to best integrate the NorthAmerican sales and
 channel operations will come next.</p>
<p>So that's it for my Digium update today. I'd like to thank the 
manyDigium folks across the U.S. who are celebrating Thanksgiving 
now,and working hard to figure out how best to integrate into 
andcontribute to the growth of our business. I expect the benefits 
ofthis integration work to start showing once the decisions are 
madeduring Q2. You will see why the addition of Digium is one 
moresignificant step on the path to building a more valuable company 
foryou, our shareholders, as we seek ways to add scale by augmenting 
ourorganic growth with selective acquisitions during a time of 
industryconsolidation.</p>
<p>With that, I'd like to discuss forward guidance for just a moment. 
Asmany of you will no doubt have noticed from our press release, 
we'vereaffirmed our commitment to delivering $100 million of revenue 
and$10 million of EBITDA during fiscal '19. Our Q1 results only serve 
toincrease our confidence in our ability to do so. Further, as 
we'veindicated before, we see a clear path to getting our 
EBITDApercentage up to 13% for fiscal 2020, and I would expect we'll be 
ontrack for that figure by the time we exit this fiscal year. It'sreally
 that simple, and our plans are, if anything, slightly moreadvanced now 
than we'd expected before Q1.</p>
<p>In summary, Sangoma is now a $100 million company with 
demonstrablegrowth, 10% EBITDA margins growing to 13%, positive cash 
flow, andwith the management to continue winning new customers, building
 newproducts and acquiring new businesses. The turnaround from a 
fewyears ago has created a strong public company with a history 
ofdelivering on its promises to both customers and shareholders.</p>
<p>We did all this while not raising a lot of additional equity 
thatwould have diluted shareholders, and while building out an 
entirelynew product portfolio, it required very significant 
R&amp;Dinvestments, completely repositioning the company, getting us on 
therecurring revenue path, buying multiple businesses and 
growingprofitability throughout the entire sequence. We've come a long 
wayand fully intend to stay on that path.</p>
<p>For these reasons, your Board of Directors feel strongly that 
Sangomaremains undervalued at today's share prices and we continue to 
workdiligently on this every day. Interestingly, since our last 
calltogether, open-source software, one key part of our business, 
hasbeen getting a lot of attention in the markets. I'm not sure how 
manyof you would have noticed the news or realized the relevance 
toSangoma, but IBM acquired Red Hat for about $34 billion recently. 
RedHat is an open source software company who was doing about $3 
billionin revenue with just under 10% profit margins and was growing 
about20% per year. Those are some encouraging signs from our point 
ofview.</p>
<p>We remain proud of our progress and our track record at Sangoma, 
andwe look forward to still further appreciation in stock price. 
Withthat, I'd like to close off my prepared remarks for today, and 
turnit back to you, David, for questions.</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> Thank you, Bill. To make sure everybody knows 
how toask questions, I will ask the operator to go over the 
instructionsagain. Operator, we are ready to take questions now, please.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from NickCorcoran from Acumen Capital.</p>
<p><b>NICK CORCORAN, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, ACUMEN CAPITAL FINANCEPARTNERS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 So I just have a question aboutEBITDA margins. They were stronger than 
anticipated in the quarter.Can you just speak to what might have turned 
that? And if any of thatwas onetime items that may not be there for the 
remainder of theyear?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. Fair question. There was no 
singleexplanation, to be honest, Nick. I'll give you a little bit of 
color,but none of the color includes significant or material onetime 
largeorders that would have caused it to spike and drive EBITDA 
up.There's a bunch of stuff going on, right? We had the first month 
ofDigium consolidated in. The third month of any quarter at Digium 
hastended to be higher than month 1 and 2. So we just happened, by 
purecoincidence, to incorporate the strongest month of the 
quarterbecause of the date of the acquisition. So that's relevant. 
Theproduct mix is highly relevant to EBITDA in any one quarter. So if 
wehappen to have orders for slightly more, I don't know, higher 
margin,software-only products versus something like a gateway that 
mightcome with lower margin, that drives up gross margins and less 
EBITDAmargins. And then, it really depends also on which regions the 
orderflow is coming from. There are some regions in the world that 
comewith slightly lower gross margins as we've talked about on 
priorcalls. So for example, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, parts 
ofLatin America come with lower margins, and if they contribute 
aslightly higher fraction of the revenue for any one quarter, thatpulls 
gross margin down a notch or 2 in EBITDA. That didn't happenthis quarter
 as you saw. So there's no one thing, and for sure, itwasn't caused by 
some anomalous order that would not repeat.</p>
<p><b>NICK CORCORAN:</b> So with EBITDA margins tracking ahead of your 
fullyear guidance, should we expect, maybe, in Q2, there'd be a 
littlebit of margin impression before they start to expand through 
theremainder of the year?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. That's a fair point. We're going 
through, asI mentioned in the Digium update, the process of planning 
theintegration. It's just -- it's the big topic for the quarter, 
right,lots of discussions about, as I said, supply chain or 
integratingsales teams, or which IT systems to use, which data centers, 
etcetera. So as those decisions are being made, the cost synergies 
thatwe are working to get to by the end of the quarter are not all 
inplace yet. And so I think it's right that the EBITDA margins in Q2are 
likely to be slight lower than the EBITDA margins in Q1, beforethey pop 
up and expand for Q3. So I can't give you specific guidanceor quantify 
that, Nick, but the question's a good one.</p>
<p><b>NICK CORCORAN:</b> That's helpful. And then, just on Digium, 
you'vehighlighted that the third month in the quarter tends to be 
stronger.Can you just quantify how much stronger it is than the first 2 
monthsof the quarter?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> It varies. So I'd hate to do that and have
 youuse any one quarter as the way to build out a model that looks 
atmultiple years. What could I share to be helpful here?</p>
<p><b>NICK CORCORAN:</b> So I guess the -- like the point I'm looking at
 is, Ithink when you acquired Digium, you said the run rate was about 
$3million a month. So can we expect that, say the fourth quarter is a$4 
million quarter, and then, the other 2 -- or $4 million a month,and 
then, the other 2 months are, say, $2.5 million? Or is it notthat strong
 a number?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> It's not that, that profile is going to be
 wrong.It may indeed be right, Nick. It's -- but it's not 
consistentlypredictable from one quarter to the next. My point here was 
makingsure that you guys understood that it is a bit higher in the 
lastmonth of the quarter, but it really shouldn't matter once 
we'relooking at steady-state quarter-to-quarter comparisons. It's 
onlyunusually impacting because of the fact that Q1 had 1 month of 
Digiumand that it happens by coincidence to be the final month of 
thequarter. But once you look at Q2 versus Q3, or Q3 versus Q4, 
thatprofile between month 1 and month 3 should not be 
causingquarter-to-quarter comparisons to be explained.</p>
<p><b>NICK CORCORAN:</b> Okay. And then, just the last question for me. 
Thebusiness integration costs in the quarter were about $2.1 million.Can
 you just comment on how much the acquisition costs or integrationcosts 
for the remainder of the year will be?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. Sure, we can talk about that. Yes. 
MaybeI'll -- if you allow me, generalize your question to include what 
isinside that $2.1 million. We had 3 e-mail questions about this priorto
 today's call, and I said to those folks, if you let me answer atonce on
 the call rather than by e-mail, and then, I'll talk aboutwhat's left to
 come. So I don't think there's anything reallysurprising in the $2.1 
million. It's all the stuff that you wouldexpect when you guys look in 
at or analyze companies that haveacquisitions as part of their strategy.
 There's the investmentbanking fees. And for some of our deals, we've 
had such fees andothers we haven't because we've been able to source 
some transactionswithout using bankers. All right. So for example, 
that's a big partof it. The deal played out over a longer period of 
time, which alwaysstretches out the fees that you're incurring during 
that period. Thetransaction from Digium's end was fairly complicated 
because ofmultiple classes of shareholders and the give-and-take between
 them.It was rep and warranty insurance, which can be expensive. It 
alsorequired due diligence from the insurance companies because of 
thedebt financing, the lender needed a quality-of-earnings reports, 
likein many audits. So there's no one thing and none of the elements 
thatmake up that $2 million are strange, or weird, or anything like 
that.The only stuff that's left, Nick, it's not the cost of closing 
thetransaction. It's the costs of getting through the cost synergies. 
Iwould expect most of that to be covered by, I don't know, $0.5million, 
$0.6 million, maybe $0.7 million. I don't know exactly. AndI think most 
of that will be in Q2, with maybe a little bit tricklinginto Q3.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question comes from Gavin Fairweather with CormarkSecurities.</p>
<p><b>GAVIN FAIRWEATHER, ANALYST OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CORMARKSECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b> Just for the record, I reallyenjoyed the tax and amortization discussion.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> More than me.</p>
<p><b>GAVIN FAIRWEATHER:</b> Just to start out here, on operating 
expenses, abit of a transition quarter for you there with Digium coming 
into themix. But they were a little bit higher than I expected. Was 
thatmostly just the Digium being layered in there? Or was there 
otheradditions kind of north of the border? Or...</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> The only other one that might be worth 
talkingabout, because it is mostly, of course, the addition of Digium, 
isyou can imagine that in the quarter where we're closing thetransaction
 and giving the integration process, there was a lot oftravel, way more 
than normal, right. A lot of people flying back andforth all the time, 
many different departments. We must have beendown there a dozen times. 
So the other substantive variation fromnormal run rate will be the 
travel expenses.</p>
<p><b>GAVIN FAIRWEATHER:</b> Okay. And then, just secondly, I'm thinking
 aboutyour mix of foreign exchange now that you have Digium in the 
mix.Obviously, more weighted towards U.S. dollar revenue. Any thoughts 
onwhether it makes sense to either to change your reporting currency 
orhedge a little bit? What are your thoughts on that, given how thatpart
 of the business has changed?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. I think the answer to those 2 
subparts toyour question are quite different, Gavin. On the part about 
reportingin U.S. currency, we talk about it pretty regularly, including 
at theboard. We're not about to change any immediate time in the 
nearfuture. But at some point down the road, it could make sense. 
There'slots of variables there, but don't look for anything in the 
shortterm. And then, secondly, about hedging. The need for hedging, 
Iwould say, has gone down, not up, and that might surprise you, 
butthat's mostly because of the size of the natural hedge, which 
reallynot a whole lot we can do to hedge the top line impact from 
FXmovement. Most of our efforts in the past, when employing 
hedgingstrategies, have been related to hedging balance sheet items that
 getrevalued at the end of each quarter. So the cash on the 
balancesheet, the receivables, the inventory, things like that. And we 
nowhave a much larger fraction of our operating expenses in U.S.dollars,
 mostly because of the number of people that are down there.So we 
haven't been hedging for the last -- David, could you help me?1.5, 2 
quarters? Yes. And for right now, Gavin, we're not planning tounless the
 set of conditions that we look at change. So I understandthe question 
but I think hedging is probably less necessary andinappropriate now than
 it was a year or 2 ago.</p>
<p><b>GAVIN FAIRWEATHER:</b> Okay. That's helpful. And this question 
might be alittle bit premature, but we've seen some volatility in the 
stockmarkets, especially with some of your really cloud-focused years. 
Iknow you're focused very much on integration of Digium at this 
point,but do you think that, at some point, maybe that factors turned 
intoprivate evaluations of the things that you're looking at?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Well, first of all, I think your kind of 
caveatat the beginning of your question is right. We are really focused.
 Onthe last call, someone asked, when does the next acquisition come?And
 all I was able to say is, we don't have a lot of spare cyclesright now 
to be looking at that. It's not in the next couple ofquarters, I would 
guess, whether the volatility affects valuations ofprivate companies, I 
think, depends on so many factors, Gavin, right?Like, of course, those 
companies who might be trying to be acquiredor approached will be paying
 attention to such things and when itserves their interest, they'll be 
pointing out, look at how the priceof businesses like ours have gone up.
 And when it doesn't serve theirinterests, they surprisingly choose not 
to cite that, but there's somany other factors, like what's going on in 
the cap table of thatcompany and what are the dynamics between the 
shareholders, how muchsome of those shareholders care about cash now 
versus cash later? Orhow much they care about cash versus rolling over 
equity that I thinkother factors are likely to dominate more than the 
volatility of thepublic comparables.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question comes from David Kwan with PI Financial.</p>
<p><b>DAVID KWAN, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, PI FINANCIAL CORP., RESEARCHDIVISION:</b>
 I want to talk on the revenue side. Looking at it from ayear-over-year 
basis, and even excluding the acquisitions. It lookslike you guys did a 
pretty good job. I think there was a large deal ayear ago, but also on a
 sequential basis, it looks like there was apretty good performance 
there, especially on the services side. And Iwas wondering, to what 
extent that might have been driven by theDigium acquisition given your 
comments, I guess, on the last month ofthe quarter being one of their 
strongest, but also, I guess, theirhigher recurring revenues from their 
cloud platform?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. I mean, of course, you're right. 
It'ssignificantly impacted by Digium, and that would be one of the 
keydrivers of the growth, both the absolute growth and the fact that 
itwas slightly stronger even than we expected. I would tell you it'snot 
only on the Digium side. Our cloud business at Sangoma is growingquite 
nicely right now. We had a very good fiscal '18 and that'scontinuing on 
into fiscal '19. It's actually quite astute. No oneasked any questions 
about this by e-mail, but you're right. Thequarter one over quarter one 
performance is even nicer when yourealize last year's Q1 had a 
significant order in it. I think it wasthe second half of a large order,
 if I remember back that far now.And then, I would say that, definitely,
 that compounding of recurringrevenue at Digium, just like it is at 
Sangoma, is the primary driverof growth, right? It's desirable not just 
because of the highermultiples that recurring revenues get, but because 
of the underlyingreason that that's true. This compounding effect we're 
seeing atDigium, we see it at Sangoma. You add the same number of gross 
adds,and if churn's not increasing, the same number of net adds and 
that'son top of the install base that you had a month or a quarter or 
ayear before. So there's nothing magic in that formula, and the growthin
 the quarter was partly Sangoma, partly Digium. And if youremember, I 
mentioned that also related to the fact that CCD came inpartway through 
last fiscal year. So it was not included in thefiscal Q1 of 2018.</p>
<p><b>DAVID KWAN:</b> That's right. David, wondering on the balance 
sheet, asit relates to the payable, that was up notably 
quarter-over-quarter.I was wondering to what extent that might have been
 all Digium orversus maybe some timing issues?</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> Almost 100% Digium.</p>
<p><b>DAVID KWAN:</b> Okay. Can you comment, I guess, guys, just on 
pipelinesince the closing of the Digium acquisitions, any changes that 
youguys have seen in terms of average size of deals or composition? 
Areyou seeing larger deals given the greater scale that you guys have?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> So let me just ask a clarifying question. Whenyou refer to pipeline in deals, are we talking customers oracquisitions here?</p>
<p><b>DAVID KWAN:</b> Customers.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Okay. Thank you. So no, nothing super 
noticeableyet, David, to be honest. It's just too early. The 
salesorganizations are getting to know each other and looking at 
thedifferent types of customers and the archetype and how 
typicalcustomers in one business are slightly different from 
typicalcustomers on the other portion of the business. But both Sangoma 
andDigium play in the small, medium, smaller enterprise size. We're 
nottypically the vendor that a government with 250,000 seats is 
comingto. And the difference between a typical customer that might have,
 Idon't know, 20 employees versus a customer that might have 
200employees, is not that big. The sales cycle looks similar. And 
soalthough we see slightly differing ranges of customer size, itdoesn't 
change the kind of marketing you use or the types of channelstructure 
you employ to get to that market. So although I would saythat the UCaaS 
business and the installed base on the Digium side ofthe company has 
slightly larger seats per customer than the installedbase of UCaaS on 
the Sangoma side, it's not hugely different, and thedifference doesn't 
cause us to need to behave or interact with thosecompanies in a 
different way.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question comes from [Peter Fritza], with -- aprivate investor.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> I just want to start off by saying 
thatI've been a shareholder a long time. I just really want to 
complimentyou, Bill, and David, and your team, on a really 
remarkableturnaround for the company, very exciting stuff. I had 2 
questionsaimed at share value. The first is, you obviously focus 
investors inyour forecast on revenue and EBITDA, which is fantastic. 
There'sstill a core of investors that look to that income almost in 
asimplistic way when they're doing a basic P/E evaluation or 
somethinglike that. I seem to recall, in the past, though, you said 
youobviously are very aware of net income, but you don't manage to it 
toartificially make it look better. So just wondering if you 
couldprovide some color on the approach of the board and you to the 
netincome line. And the second question around shareholder value. Areyou
 monitoring whether the listing could move to the TSX at somepoint?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Okay. Good questions. First of all, thank 
you forthe kind words at the beginning. That's much appreciated, and 
it'snice to talk to you. I don't know if we've interacted very much 
inthe past. If you've been a shareholder for the long time, it's niceto 
have you on the call. So the second of your 2 questions is simplerand 
easier. Yes, a potential up-listing to the TSX is stuff we'reactively 
talking about now. There's no definitive decision made yet,Peter. David 
and I, and our General Counsel, and the Board havediscussed this. There 
are advantages and disadvantages of doing that.I think, in general, our 
view is that the advantages outweigh thedisadvantages. But going further
 than that would be inappropriate atthis point other than just to say, 
it's a logical question and alogical decision we're working through. 
It's not imminent in the nextquarter or 2, but once we're through the 
Digium acquisition andintegration, it would make perfectly good sense 
for us to look atthat quite seriously. Now the second part -- yes. Yes. 
And the secondpart of your -- or maybe the first part of your question, 
about netincome and EPS, I hope you won't take my prior comments as in 
any waydismissive about net income or EPS. Really what we were trying to
 sayis, there's a bunch of metrics that shareholders and investors 
coulduse to try and evaluate the performance of a business, and it 
seemslike it's our job to try and direct investors to the ones that 
wethink are most telling. So it's not that net income is lackingutility 
or EPS is unwise to look at. It just doesn't seem to us asuseful 
compared to something like EBITDA. And that's partly relatedto the stage
 the company is at. You referred to the massiveturnaround. We feel much 
better about where the business is now thanwhere it was 5 years ago. But
 we're still a small company, and wewant that to change as we get 
bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Andthen, some of the volatility comes 
out of the EPS. And right now,things like depreciation and amortization,
 especially amortization asyou heard me talk about, have this very big 
effect on both EBT andthen, my other comment, tax rates on net income, 
that it seems likethere's a risk, if you look at that too singularly, 
you get adistorted picture. Right? And so that's why we encourage people
 tolook at EBITDA. It's not because we don't care about net income, orwe
 don't talk about it, we absolutely talk about it in internaldiscussions
 and at the board level. It just doesn't seem like asuseful a barometer 
of company performance for us at this pointcompared to EBITDA. That's 
all.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question comes from Gabriel Leung with BeaconSecurities.</p>
<p><b>GABRIEL LEUNG, RESEARCH ANALYST OF TECHNOLOGY, BEACON SECURITIESLIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 A couple of things. Bill, just as itrelates to Digium and its 
contribution to your financials, you sortof alluded to it being back-end
 loaded. So you saw a pretty strongSeptember month. I'm kind of curious,
 with the -- you've got sort of2 additional months of data now, I guess.
 Just curious to hear yourthoughts around how Digium is performing in 
the first 2 months ofcalendar Q4. You earlier discussed whether it's 
sort of in line-ishor perhaps a little bit over and above what you had 
been hoping tosee?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. I don't think I'm really at liberty 
to talkabout that. So we do have results from October. It's definitely 
notpossible to comment on November. And until I have, I don't know, 
like2, maybe even 3 quarters, Gabe, to understand a little bit about 
thatmonth-to-month profile, for me to drive too positively or 
toonegatively about a first month when it's the first, first month 
underour ownership seems, it just seems unwise. I hope you won't feel 
likeI'm being evasive, but it's like one single data point out of 
amillion, and drawing any conclusion from it, I think, just is notgood. 
We'll be able to tell you more about how that first month looksonce we 
get through January or April, and I have a couple of themunder my belt.</p>
<p><b>GABRIEL LEUNG:</b> I got you, and I appreciate that. I guess my 
lastquestion would be, well, looking at Sangoma, I mean, you guys 
haveclearly scaled up pretty meaningfully over the last couple of 
years.I'm just curious to hear whether there's been a change in terms 
ofhow your market, whether it's your competitors or your customers 
haveviewed the company or whether the narrative of the company 
ischanged? Any feedback around that I think will be pretty 
interesting.And I guess, specifically, I'm looking for evidence of 
whether or notyour bigger scale might increase the breadth of customers 
that you'redealing with and perhaps also the size of deal flow that you 
mightsee come through?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. Good questions. I'll just think about
 that alittle bit. Maybe I'll offer 2 separate points as I think through
 myanswer in realtime. One is, yes, and then, I'll add some color 
onthat, and I'll come to the second point. So I try my very best 
asconstrained by how many hours there are in a day and how many days ina
 month, to get face time with customers, to read, just how are 
theyfeeling about our company, and our people, and our products. I 
travelwidely to do that. That includes both end-user customers, 
OEMcustomers and channels, and that hasn't changed either right beforeor
 right after the acquisition. So I continue to be in front of ourbiggest
 customers. I've visited Digium's largest customer in theworld, in the 
U.S. I visited the top 2 European distributors. I'mplanning, in 2 weeks,
 to be in front of the top 2 or 3 OEM customersin the world for Digium. 
So I think I can tell you both from feedbackI hear from staff about what
 they're getting from the market, and aswell from just personal face 
time, that the reaction to the scalingup of Sangoma, including Digium as
 another step along that process,but not the only step, as you said, is 
everybody notices. Right? Ifwe're talking to a potential channel 
partner, or an existingcustomer, it's the very first thing that comes 
up, that there arevery few companies in this industry that have gone 
through the sizeof metamorphosis that we have. We were a $10 million 
company a fewyears ago. Right? So it's very reassuring to them. In the 
specificcase of the Digium step along the way, as the most recent 
componentof that growth, one of the things that I'm hearing from 
thosecustomers is, it's very beneficial to us to have people nearer to 
us.And the fact that there is an office in the U.K., or people 
inGermany, or people in France or -- that is noticed right away as 
abenefit of the acquisition. So I feel really good about that. Andthen, 
you asked about, is it affecting the type of customer,including by size?
 And I would say, it's a little bit noticeable, butnot as much as I 
think it will be over the next couple of years,Gabe. It's not like we've
 started getting calls every single day fromcompanies that are 10x the 
size of the traditional customer base. Butwe absolutely are winning more
 larger customers. It's just verygradual. It's true both in more 
traditional on-premise typecustomers, and also in the cloud. I would say
 the size, the number ofemployees, or seats, or extensions, of a cloud 
customer is graduallygoing up over time, and that's a good sign, as well
 as the size ofcompanies that choose to buy product from us. We've got, I
 don'tknow, last year we had $1 million or $2 million-plus deals, which 
isnot the norm for us. We've got one in the works now and a salesfunnel 
that may go somewhere. So that feels new, but it feels likeit's on the 
very beginning of that trend, Gabe.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from [DerekSirimba], a private investor.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> Yes. So I was wondering -- I mean, 
youmentioned a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, I 
waswondering if you can add a bit more color to, I guess, on a 
broaderlevel, what kind of steps you're prioritizing for the integration
 nowversus what steps you're focusing -- going to focus on more later? 
Orlike what divisions, or areas, or what the integration plan reallyis?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Well, that's still -- we could be here for
 3 dayson that topic. It as wide as the company operates. Right? So 
youcould imagine there is activity in almost all function ofdisciplines.
 So I touched on, I don't even know now 2, or 3, or 4 ofthem, 3 or 4 of 
them, in my prepared remarks. But I just had toselect some highlights, 
otherwise, like I said, it would go onforever. There's a very detailed 
integration plan document. We meetas a management team once a week. 
There are ongoing discussions aboutthe organization of the company and 
our people, and how to structurethem into which departments, and which 
people will lead which groups.There are discussions, as I said, about 
supply chain, and thatincludes the very beginning of the supply chain, 
the middle, and theend, so what I mean by that is, from which companies 
we sourceproduct that typically means contract manufacturers. Sangoma 
had aseries of contract manufacturers, as did Digium. We're 
alreadystarting to align those. We've begin to reduce the number of CMs 
thatwe need and put more volume into fewer manufacturers, the 
logisticsmiddle part of that is how do we get product from a source 
ofmanufacturer to us, and stuff in that area happens like every 
singleday or -- there was a humorous one, if you're just looking for a 
bitof color in to get an instinctive feel for it. We're trying to 
getsome large shipments of Digium phones in our warehouses in time 
forshipping at the end of this quarter, and Digium typically shippedonly
 full containers of phones, and Sangoma's more traditionally beenable to
 ship less than full containers, including pallets, and youcan't put 
full containers on planes, but you can put pallets on --it's very 
operational at some levels as well. And then, the latterstages of the 
supply chain include, where do we house product in ourinventory, and 
then, pick, pack, and ship from. How many of thoseplaces do you need and
 how do you staff it? So all of that acrosssupply chain is taking place.
 I mentioned sales. The sales teams arebeginning to talk. We've had 
multiple -- multiple-day planningmeetings amongst the management teams, 
talking about channel partnersand the structure of the sales 
departments. I mentioned to you thatwe're integrating the Rest of World 
stuff before North America. Thatwas actually a bit of a switch. We 
thought we might start in NorthAmerica, but once we get into the 
planning, you realize there's a lotmore work there because there's 2 
different separate teams, and 2different sets of systems. In marketing, 
there's 2 different sets ofCRM tools and marketing automation tools. We 
have to figure out whichones you're going to use and standardize on, and
 how do you get allthe contact data for customers and prospects out of 
one and intoanother to allow regular contacts. It's just -- it's 
everywhere. Theengineering team's thinking about how do we structure 
teams thatbuilt 2 different PBXs into one team, so that you only have to
 dodevelopment of the feature once, not twice. I feel like I'm kind 
oframbling because that's what you wanted just to get an instinctive 
orgut feel. I'll stop and pause, and ask if you want more or 
somethingmore specific?</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> No. That's some great color. I guess
 -- Imean, you spoke to it, I think, on the last call anyways, but any 
--and it's been a month, I guess, since then, but any unexpected, 
Iguess, unexpected benefits or issues to kind of speak to on 
theintegration side?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Well, I mean, sure, right? If you hear a 
CEO say,there's tons of stuff going on in that area across all areas of 
thecompany, both high-level strategic stuff and down in the 
weedsoperational stuff, you would realize right away, that 
there'sdefinitely surprises that come up here and there. Last call, I 
said,there were some positive and some negative, but none -- 
nothingreally of the magnitude that would justify me pointing it out on 
acall like this. If you wanted an example, even though they're notbig, 
huge examples, the description I just gave you of the veryinitial first 
reaction, we've had from international customers ofDigium to being told,
 oh, that's so great. You have sales and servicepeople in India, or 
someone who can come and visit me in Munich or inParis. And maybe 
there's more business we could do with you if weknow there's local 
people who understand us and can visit us morefrequently. That's been a 
pleasant surprise. I mean, of course,instinctively, it makes sense and 
you hope that will happen. Buthearing them say it, without being 
prompted, is really encouraging.So that's just one random example.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from [Igor Savelson], a privateinvestor.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> If I may, just one question about 
thecompetitive dynamics. Would you please just talk a little bit 
aboutthat, and how they might -- how you see those flying out over 
thenext several years?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Okay. Yes. So the competitive nature of 
ourbusiness is such that when we've discussed this on prior calls, 
I'veexplained that who we compete against can differ widely based 
uponthe product line we're talking about. And so the competitors 
insomething like, I don't know, gateways, is a totally different set 
ofcompetitors from on-premise PBXs, from a UCaaS service. And so 
whenwe're thinking about that competitive landscape and understanding 
whowe're fighting against, then benchmarking products against or 
makingsure our sales team is equipped with competitive intelligence, 
thestuff they get varies depending upon which product line theparticular
 prospect is they're speaking to in any one salesengagement. Right? So 
-- but you don't think I'm being too ethereal,if it's -- I'll pick each 
of those examples I gave. In the gatewaylines, I would say we would bump
 into companies like AudioCodes,which is a public company from Israel 
that you could look up. Andthen, there's a couple of private companies 
that would be small anddifficult for you to know anything about. There's
 one in the U.S.called Patton, for example, that we occasionally see. 
There's someChinese manufacturers of gateways, company called 
Grandstream, forexample. On the on-premise PBX side, I would say that 
the majority ofthe installed base is still controlled by the traditional
 PBXcompanies from the '80s, '90s and 2000s. Firms like Avaya, if 
youcome from the voice side of the world; or Cisco, if you come from 
thedata side of the world. They will be at the higher end of the 
marketdown to what would have been traditional key systems and 
PBXmanufacturers. Panasonic has a key system vendor of Toshiba in thePBX
 world, and that changes over time. Companies like Toshiba havecome in 
and out of the business. Toshiba, for reasons that were quiteunrelated 
to communications, exited the PBX world because of problemswith an 
acquisition of a nuclear business. And then, in the UCaaSspace, it's 
newer companies that are not the same incumbents thatcontrol the 
on-premise PBX world 20 years ago. Companies likeRingCentral, or 8x8, 
firms that you may not know the name of, some ofwhich are publicly 
traded, so you can go and see some data on those.And then, from that 
large type of customers and that product categorydown to a whole bunch, 
dozens or hundreds of little tiny $1 millionhosted PBX businesses, one 
guy and his brother in a garage building asmall platform and signing up 
customers in their city. So it's quitediverse, and the industry has been
 fragmented too widely in mostpeople's view. And thus, the consolidation
 that you're seeing overrecent periods.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> I see. So about pricing pressure, do youthink they'll start being more of a factor with time? Or are you notseeing?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Yes. Again, I mean, all of these things 
relatedto the conservative nature of the business vary from product line
 toproduct line. So we have product categories, where pricing is 
notgoing down at all. And in some cases, can go up as products near 
theend of their life cycle and there are fewer competitors left. We 
haveproduct categories that are kind of in the middle, flat, not 
changingvery much, plus or minus a little bit. And then, there are 
productcategories that are more competitive. The cloud business is 
viewed asthe thing that attracts the most capital and the highest 
valuations.So there are more players entering that. It's a little bit 
more pricecompetitive. It's probably coming down a little bit at the 
pricelevel each year. And at the same time as there's a little bit 
ofprice pressure, there's also pressure from those vendors to 
offerhigher incentives to be -- to the channel partners and agents by 
wayof commissions. So although that's not pricing, it's cost 
pressuressqueezing in the middle. So we just have to pay attention to 
that.We're very good at it. We don't just compete head to head and 
blowour brains out. We have selective markets that allow us to 
generallydo something that's a bit unique and maintain healthier margins
 thanmost of the competitors out there are able to get that one, as 
yousee.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> The next question comes from [Dean Proje], a privateinvestor.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER:</b> I just have one quick question or 
maybe,hopefully, it's a quick question. Can you give me some context 
onyour shareholder base, kind of retail versus institutional, 
andanything to note from a geographical standpoint?</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Okay. Sure. What we're able to. We have an
 annualgeneral meeting on -- David, could you please make sure I 
--Thursday, the 20th? Is that right?</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> Correct.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> Thursday, the 20th of December. Anyone who
 is onthe call and would like to join us, you'd be most welcome. That 
eventgives us a little bit of information about the shareholder base. 
AndI guess as you would note, not everybody chooses to be known, so 
itcan be a little tricky for public companies to answer this questionin a
 completely definitive way. Here's what I can share. So it's verywidely 
held. The insiders made up of management and directors isaround, I don't
 know, David, 14%, 15% or something like that?</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> The majority of the vote outside of that 
isobviously a mix of retail and institutional. The company had not 
verymany institutional shareholders 5 years ago. That has been 
changingquite rapidly over the last few years as more institutions 
becomeaware of the company as the company has grown and the market cap 
hasincreased, then, it's more applicable in their eyes. So we've now 
gota number of significant institutional investors, fund managers. 
Someof those are visible to you from public filings like PenderFund 
inVancouver, which I can cite, because the information is in the 
publicdomain. We have relationships with many others who we know and 
speakto regularly and visit on-site, but who often choose not to be 
knownand are below the threshold where they need to declare. So I hope 
youwould appreciate that it's not in anyone's best interest for me tosay
 that stuff if they don't want it to be disclosed. And then, westill 
have a large set of retail shareholders, some of which are inCanada, 
which is I guess what you're asking. And many of which are inthe U.S. I 
was in Silicon Valley for some meetings about 2 months agoand went to 
visit a significant individual shareholder down there. Sowhere we can, 
and where it's possible, we talk to both institutionaland retail. And 
we're starting to spend a little bit more timetalking to the retail base
 through organizations and events than wehave in the past. We've done 
presentations at a couple of retailconferences in the last year, gone 
and met with folks who manageretail books at a brokerage, or write 
advice columns and have a baseof subscribers following them. So with 
that, I would say, it's newerin the last 2, or maybe, 3 years.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> This concludes the question-and-answer session. I 
wouldlike to turn the conference back over to Mr. Moore for any 
closingremarks.</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> Thank you, operator. We really appreciate 
everybodyjoining us today for the first call for this year. We will be 
havingmore information with regard to the acquisition and other things 
inour next call. Just a reminder, we will have a recording of the 
callavailable on our website shortly. We really appreciate your 
support.As Bill indicated, you'd be welcome to the AGM. Other than 
that,please enjoy the rest of your day.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> David, is there information about address 
andstuff for the AGM somewhere? The shareholders have that, obviously,in
 the mailing post. It's at our offices here in Markham. You'd bewelcome 
to join us. 10:00 a.m.? Do you know?</p>
<p><b>DAVID S. MOORE:</b> It's 10:00 a.m, yes.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM J. WIGNALL:</b> 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, the 20th of December, ifyou'd like to come. Okay, everyone, thank you for joining. Bye fornow.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnectyour lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good morning. My name is Jessa, and I will be your 
conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome 
everyone to the Metro Inc. 2018 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. 
(Operator Instructions)</p>
<p> Mr. Roberto Sbrugnera, Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.</p>
<p> ROBERTO SBRUGNERA, VP OF TREASURY, RISK &amp; IR, METRO INC.: 
Thanks, Jessa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us 
today. Our comments today will focus on the financial results of our 
fourth quarter, which ended September 29, 2018.</p>
<p> Joining me today is Mr. Eric La Flèche, President and Chief 
Executive Officer; François Thibault, Executive VP and Chief Financial 
Officer.</p>
<p> During the call, we will present our fourth quarter results and 
comment on its highlights. We'll then be happy to take your questions.</p>
<p> Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we will use in 
today's discussions different statements that could be construed as 
forward-looking information. In general, any statement which does not 
constitute an historical fact may be deemed as a forward-looking 
statement. Expressions such as expect, intend or confident that, will 
and other similar expressions are generally indicative of 
forward-looking statements.</p>
<p> The forward-looking statements are based upon certain assumptions 
regarding the Canadian food and pharmaceutical industry, the general 
economy and our annual budget as well as our 2018-2019 action plan. 
These forward-looking statements do not provide any guarantees as to the
 future performance of the company and are subject to potential risks, 
known and unknown, as well as uncertainties that could cause the outcome
 to differ materially. A description of the risks, which could have an 
impact on these statements, could be found under the Risk Management 
section of our 2017 annual report. We believe these statements to be 
reasonable and pertinent at this time and represent our expectations. 
The company does not intend to update any forward-looking information 
except required by applicable law.</p>
<p> I would like to turn the conference now to François.</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, METRO INC.: 
Thank you, Roberto, and good morning, everyone. Before I go through our 
results, I just want to remind everyone that 2017 was a 53-week year 
versus 52 weeks for this year 2018. And the impact of the extra week 
represents about $258 million in sales and $11.9 million in net earnings
 or $0.05 a share.</p>
<p> The acquisition of The Jean Coutu Group was completed on May 11 of 
this year, and consequently, we have been consolidating The Jean Coutu 
results for slightly more than 20 weeks. And during that period, 
synergies of $6.6 million were realized for an annual run rate of $17 
million. The integration of The Jean Coutu Group is well on track.</p>
<p> In the quarter, we recorded a pharmacy network closure and 
restructuring charge of $23 million after taxes, resulting from the 
forthcoming transfer of operations from the McMahon warehouse to The 
Jean Coutu warehouse in Varennes, the reduction of administrative 
positions, the closure of 3 Brunet pharmacies and the divestiture of 10 
pharmacies as required by the Competition Bureau.</p>
<p> So turning to our results. Total sales for the fourth quarter 
reached $3.7 billion versus $3.2 billion last year, that's an increase 
of 15.7%. Excluding $690.7 million of sales from The Jean Coutu Group in
 this quarter and removing the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017,
 sales were up 2.5%.</p>
<p> Food same-store sales were up 2.1%, and our food basket experienced inflation of about 0.8%.</p>
<p> Pharmacy same-store sales were up 1.8%, that's 0.7% for prescription
 drugs and 3.9% for front of store sales, and the number of 
prescriptions grew by 2.5% year-over-year.</p>
<p> Gross margins came in at 19.7% of sales in the fourth quarter 
compared to 19.6% last year. And operating expenses as a percentage of 
sales came in at 12.6% versus 12.3% last year. Excluding the pharmacy 
network closure and restructuring expenses of $31.4 million pretax, our 
SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales stood at 11.7%. The lower SG&amp;A 
ratio was due in part to the inclusion of The Jean Coutu but is 
partially offset by increases in operating expenses, mainly minimum 
wage, transportation and fuel costs.</p>
<p> Adjusted EBITDA stood at $297.9 million, up $61.8 million or 26.2% 
and represented 8% of sales. On a comparable 12-week basis and excluding
 Jean Coutu's EBITDA of $74.2 million, adjusted EBITDA amounted to 
$223.7 million, and that's a 2.2% increase over last year's quarter and 
7.3% of sales.</p>
<p> The income tax expense for the quarter was $48.1 million, 
representing an effective tax rate of 24.9% compared with last year's 
effective tax rate of 23.4%.</p>
<p> Net earnings for the quarter were $145 million versus $154.9 million
 last year, and earnings per share were $0.56 for the quarter versus 
$0.66 last year.</p>
<p> On an -- on an adjusted basis, net earnings were $161 million 
compared with $119.2 million last year on a comparable 12-week basis and
 that's up 35.1%. Adjusted EPS were $0.63 versus $0.51 last year, that's
 up 23.5%.</p>
<p> We are pleased with our cash flow performance. The deleveraging of 
our balance sheet is occurring at a faster pace than originally 
forecasted, and in the fourth quarter, we sold all the remaining 
Couche-Tard shares for gross proceeds of $326 million. And these 
proceeds, combined with the free cash flow generated, allowed us to 
reimburse about $850 million of debt since the acquisition of Jean Coutu
 on May 11.</p>
<p> Our financial leverage now stands at our targeted adjusted 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5, and consequently, the Board of Directors 
yesterday authorized the reinstatement of our share repurchase program, 
which will enable us to repurchase in the normal course of business 
between November 23, 2018, and November 22, 2019 up to $7 million of our
 common shares.</p>
<p> That's it for me. I will now turn it over to Eric.</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; NON-INDEPENDENT 
DIRECTOR, METRO INC.: Thank you, François, and good morning, everyone. 
As you know, fiscal 2018 was a pivotal year in our company's history 
with the acquisition of The Jean Coutu Group. We believe we now have a 
significantly stronger platform to meet our customers' everyday needs in
 food, pharmacy and health and beauty and to grow their loyalty to our 
brands.</p>
<p> Turning to our fourth quarter. We are pleased with our results, 
ending the year on a strong note and delivering solid growth on pretty 
much all key metrics. Food same-store sales grew by 2.1% in a very 
competitive market. Food inflation increased slightly during the quarter
 as our internal food basket was up 0.8%, up from 0.5% in the third 
quarter. Traffic, basket and tonnage were all up. Despite continued 
pressure on operating expenses, namely minimum wage, transportation and 
fuel costs, our teams did a great job to mitigate most of these cost 
increases.</p>
<p> We are also pleased with our pharmacy same-store sales showing 
strong prescription count growth and very solid front-store sales growth
 of 3.9%, driven by growth in all core categories, notably OTC. We also 
saw good growth in our summer seasonal and back-to-school programs.</p>
<p> For fiscal '18, CapEx totaled $317 million as we opened 4 new 
stores, expanded, renovated or remodeled 26 stores and closed 3 stores 
for a net increase of 0.3% or 60,000 square feet. We are quite happy 
with the sales lift from our recent food store remodeling projects in 
both Québec and Ontario.</p>
<p> So as François mentioned, The Jean Coutu integration plan is on 
track. We are actively working on procurement synergies and have also 
reduced some admin positions to support the new pharmacy division. You 
may have noticed that The Jean Coutu pharmacies have started to offer 
Selection and Irresistible food private label products, and Brunet has 
now started selling Personnelle brand OTC products. Soon, our food 
stores will also carry some items from Jean Coutu's Personnelle brand, 
which has built a solid reputation here in Québec.</p>
<p> We are confident in delivering the $75 million run rate in synergies
 at the end of 3 years. We are also in the process of getting site plan 
approvals for our new automated fresh and frozen DCs in Toronto. We 
expect to start construction in early 2019. So as you can see, we are 
investing in our infrastructure and in technology to become more 
efficient and provide better service to our stores, and ultimately, to 
our customers.</p>
<p> On the e-commerce front, sales continued to grow in Québec as we 
continue to attract new customers to the Metro brand as well as growing 
share of wallet from our existing customers. We will be launching a 
similar service in Ontario in 2019 as planned.</p>
<p> In closing, we don't normally give guidance, but I will say that we 
are feeling positive about our prospects for fiscal '19 as we will soon 
lap significant cost headwinds, food inflation seems to be returning to 
more normal levels and the industry's square footage growth remains 
modest.</p>
<p> Those are my comments. We'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Peter Sklar from BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p> JENNIFER L. PANES, ASSOCIATE, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: 
This is Jennifer filling in for Peter. My first question is just on the 
inflation. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on 
where that was coming from? Any specific categories? And if it was in 
line with what you kind of expected for the quarter?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Okay. Thank you for the question. So yes, we 
did see a pickup in inflation throughout the quarter. A lot of it driven
 by mix. So it's our internal basket. So mostly mix, but also some dairy
 products saw some price increases and produce also saw some increases 
mostly driven by transport. So all-in-all, I think the key message is 
that inflation picked up a bit, which we think is positive and we're 
continuing to see that into Q1.</p>
<p> JENNIFER L. PANES: Okay. And then on the drug retail same-store 
sales, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on
 the driver of the strong front-store comp?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, I can't say much more for competitive 
reasons than I said in my opening remarks. I think the core categories 
that drive traffic, the drug stores, were good, notably OTC, that's the 
key one. But on the front store, the seasonal programs worked well, the 
summer and back-to-school. So happy with those sales. So very happy with
 the sales.</p>
<p> JENNIFER L. PANES: Okay. And then on the NCIB renewal, do you plan 
to be active on that? Or is that more just when you're ready you'll go 
ahead with that?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: François is going to take that.</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT: Yes. We'll be in a position very shortly to do 
some buybacks. So we will do it as we did before, keeping in line our 
target financial leverage. So we will be -- we could expect us to be 
active regularly throughout the year.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Petrie from CIBC.</p>
<p> MARK ROBERT PETRIE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY 
RESEARCH &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: So just following up in terms of the grocery market overall, 
are you seeing changes with regards to traffic performance between 
conventional and discount? And any sort of evidence of consumers either 
trading down or shifting to better value products or package sizes?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: No. I can't say that we are seeing any big 
change in that regard throughout fiscal '18 or between Q3 and Q4. It's 
pretty similar. We're happy with our performance. I think our 
merchandises -- merchandisers did a great job in both discount and 
conventional. As I said in the third quarter, very happy with the 
conventional performance, the economy is strong, our CapEx projects are 
resonating well. I think that the guys are doing a good job in getting 
traffic into our stores, and once they're in that store, selling that 
extra item. So a good performance.</p>
<p> MARK ROBERT PETRIE: Okay. And then with regards to the synergy 
progress with Jean Coutu, I wonder if you can just give any sense in 
terms of sort of the split to this point between gross margin and 
SG&amp;A? Or maybe your expectations for how each of those would 
progress? And then related to that, Pro Doc into the Brunet network, is 
that currently offered? And what sort of takeup are you seeing that 
versus -- seeing there versus what you have in The Jean Coutu network?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: So on the first part, we're not going to give
 you a split between gross margin and SG&amp;A. I said we're focused 
very much on procurement synergies right now so that goes into -- most 
of that goes into gross margin for obvious -- it's pretty obvious. But 
we're going to give you the run rate number, the progress we're making 
as we said we were, but we don't intend to split that into more detail. 
Pro Doc, the generic drug company, yes, has started to sell to Brunet 
pharmacists. It's the pharmacist's decision. So we hope that they will 
become Pro Doc customers, but it's their decision and that -- we'll see 
over time how it plays out. But we're confident that Pro Doc will 
provide great service and will be a good supplier partner to the Brunet 
franchisees as they are for the Coutu franchisees. So it's started, and 
it's going to build over time.</p>
<p> MARK ROBERT PETRIE: Okay. And one another question, I guess. I'm 
interested just to sort of hear your perspectives on the fit of the 2 
companies together. Just in terms of areas or functions where each 
organization sort of brings relative strengths or core competencies? And
 what are sort of the best opportunities that you see in terms of being 
able to leverage those into the other platform?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, I think the fit is very good. I think 
we're off -- we've been working together for a few months now. I think 
the teams are very engaged. We have a good work plan to group some 
functions, that's already started. So the support functions, be it IT, 
HR, finance and all of those things, have been combined to service the 
new pharmacy division. It serves both banners. So Coutu&nbsp;is the 
clear leader of pharmacy in Québec. So obviously, their core competency 
is pharmacy more than Metro was. So I think we benefit from that for 
sure -- we are a stronger company together, that's for sure. We have 
core competencies on the food side. I think we are good on the cost 
control. I think we execute well, so do they. So I think it's very 
promising. And I think we have some time ahead of us to realize the full
 potential of this combination. I think I've said it before, it 
positions us better than ever to service, especially Québec customers 
for their everyday needs. I think we -- if we do our job right, we will 
earn the right to be part of customers' lives. And hopefully, they will 
shop our stores every day, be it food or health and beauty, I think we 
will be there to service their customers. So very confident about the 
fit.</p>
<p> MARK ROBERT PETRIE: Okay. I mean, I guess, I was -- I mean, I 
certainly appreciate all of that. I guess, I was more asking in terms of
 the functionalities, be it promotional effectiveness, data analytics, 
marketing. Are there opportunities to leverage particular strengths of 
Metro into the operations of Jean Coutu or vice versa? Or is it simply a
 matter of serve the fit of grocery and pharmacy?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, over time, for sure, data -- we have a 
lot of data at Metro, they have a lot of data at Coutu. So yes, over 
time, we will combine those and serve our customers even better and make
 even better personalized offers. They have -- we have competencies in 
e-commerce that I'm sure Coutu&nbsp;will benefit from over time. So 
clearly, yes, support functions and stuff that can be put in -- together
 in common will happen over time, one thing at a time. We have an 
execution plan for this integration. Step-by-step, we're going to go 
through that -- through it and create value for our customers and for 
our shareholders.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Irene Nattel from RBC Capital Markets.</p>
<p> IRENE ORA NATTEL, MD OF GLOBAL EQUITY RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS,
 LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just thinking about the competitive environment
 and competitive intensity versus the inflationary cost pressures. What 
are you seeing in terms of flyers, in terms of flyer pricing, depth of 
promotions? And also from a consumer spending perspective, what are you 
seeing in terms of trends around percentage of transactions on 
promotion?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: So Irene, I would say the competitive 
environment has remained stable quarter-over-quarter. So it's very 
promotional, it's very competitive. Nobody is giving an inch. But I 
would say flyer promotional price intensity is stable, that -- I would 
leave it at that. It's competitive out there. Our guys are doing a good 
job to merchandise and differentiate and attract customers. So confident
 that we can continue to succeed.</p>
<p> IRENE ORA NATTEL: That's great. And have you seen any change in sort
 of percentage of transactions on promotion? Or is that also stable?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Overall, no. There is -- some banners will 
have a little less promo than the period -- the quarter before or the 
year before. But overall, for the business, I would say on the food 
side, the promotional ratios are pretty much the same. But one comment I
 would say is that they're not increasing. So stable is the best way to 
put it.</p>
<p> IRENE ORA NATTEL: That's great. And just from an e-commerce 
perspective, certainly, as a Metro customer, I'm getting the promotions 
around free delivery. When you do those sorts of promotions, do you see a
 significant uptick in activity? And really, you see -- as you try 
different promotional strategies in e-commerce what seems to be the most
 effective and where the consumer hot-buttons seem to be?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, Irene, for competitive reasons, I don't
 think we should disclose what's working and what's not. So the 
e-commerce business is building customer count and sales, doing nicely. 
We're happy with the sales progress that we have. So they do, as any 
business does, some promotional strategies. So some of it's free 
delivery, some of it's x dollars off your next order or something like 
that. So I won't comment just to say that we're happy with the sales 
progress we have in e-commerce.</p>
<p> IRENE ORA NATTEL: Understood. And just one final, if I may. In terms
 of following up on the Brunet -- or sorry, Pro Doc product into Brunet.
 Are you offering any sort of special incentives or anything for the 
Brunet pharmacists to buy from Pro Doc?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: No. And that's not legally possible. It's 
medications, and you cannot give any incentive whatsoever. The only 
incentive we can provide is great service, great variety, availability, 
in-stock and that's what Brunet -- that's what Pro Doc offers.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shreedhar from National Bank.</p>
<p> VISHAL SHREEDHAR, ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH 
DIVISION: I'm just wondering about some of the longer-term synergy 
optionality associated with The Jean Coutu transaction, stuff that isn't
 necessarily included in the $75 million. So as you think about that, 
should we consider sales -- the sales opportunity to be the largest 
benefit? And within sales, are there a few items that we could think 
about that would be bigger drivers of potential benefit for those 
banners?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, we -- when we came out with $75 million
 over 3 years, that was on the cost side. We will stick to that number. 
Yes, we do see some potential sales lift opportunities. We've already 
talked about Pro Doc, and we've talked -- I've said in my opening 
remarks, private label across banners. Seasonal programs, Coutu is quite
 strong in seasonal programs. Hopefully, we can benefit from that on the
 Metro side. So yes, we do see sales opportunities down the road over 
time. But I'm not going to put a number on that or a timing on that. And
 we will work on it, but it would be -- it would not be smart to give 
you a number at this stage.</p>
<p> VISHAL SHREEDHAR: Okay. So within this quarter, you obviously are 
working on some of those initiatives, which aren't quantifying. How 
would you consider the consumer reception to the amalgamation of these 
brands between banners?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: So far so good. I'm told that the Selection 
and Irresistibles food offering that we put into the Coutu stores is 
doing really well. So it's good -- off to a good start. It's really 
early days, and it's a limited assortment, let's be clear. So I don't 
want to blow this out of proportion. It just goes to show that there's 
potential for efficiencies and it's offering something to balance the 
customer, increasing our private label volume so we can get a better 
cost. So I think it's all positive, and we'll build it over time.</p>
<p> VISHAL SHREEDHAR: Okay. And on the actual PJC franchisees 
themselves, what has been the reception to some of the initiatives that 
Metro is proposing? Have they been generally -- have they generally been
 accommodative? Or are there issues that may restrict some of these 
initiatives that you hope to implement?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, there has been no change to the 
franchisee business relations with Coutu. It's business as usual for -- 
on the Coutu&nbsp;side, except for the private label introductions and 
the promotion last summer across Québec for all of our banners in which 
they participated and did well with. The rest is really business as 
usual. There is no change on them. There is more change on the Brunet 
side to change the systems and then eventually switch to another 
warehouse. So that's where the heavy lifting will be over the next year 
or so, more on the Brunet side than the Coutu&nbsp;side.</p>
<p> VISHAL SHREEDHAR: Okay. And I'm not sure the extent to which you can
 comment on this, but there is a general perception that Québec's market
 seems to be doing a little bit better than the rest of Canada. Is that 
something that you're seeing? And is there some consumer difference that
 you're noticing within your markets?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, we are in Québec and Ontario, and we're
 very happy with our performance in Ontario. So I can't comment for the 
rest of Canada. Québec, we're happy with the results, very competitive 
market. We're holding our own and the same in Ontario. So -- not much 
else I can add.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Durran from Barclays.</p>
<p> JAMES DURRAN, MD, HEAD OF CANADIAN EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR 
ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm just wondering on the
 legacy business. Can you tell us whether the gross margin was up or 
down on the legacy business in the quarter? And whether SG&amp;A was an 
assist as well to EBITDA growth?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: François?</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT: Yes. The gross margin -- the Coutu&nbsp;numbers 
have -- has a lower gross margin than the food and a lower SG&amp;A. So 
the gross margin, if you exclude Coutu, would have been higher than the 
19.7% we published.</p>
<p> JAMES DURRAN: And that would have been up versus last year then?</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT: Last year, it was 19.6%. And so we showed 19.7% 
this quarter. So it would have been higher than 19.7% without Coutu.</p>
<p> JAMES DURRAN: Okay. And on e-commerce, like, are we at a juncture 
within the Québec business where it's meaningful enough to be assisting 
on comp store sales? And is it negatively affecting EBITDA margin in the
 Québec market?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: For us, we are adding those sales to our 
same-store sales on the Metro banner. So no, we -- it's a slight benefit
 to the same-store sales. It remains a small proportion of the banner 
sales. So it's not that significant at all. It's still an investment. 
We're affecting EBITDA negatively to answer your question. It's not 
contributing right now, but we're confident that over time, as we 
fine-tune our model, we will scale up that we will get there, but we're 
not there yet.</p>
<p> JAMES DURRAN: And so as you look at 2019, I mean, obviously, there's
 a lot of positive shifts as you mentioned at the beginning of the call 
in terms of headwinds last year turning into at least neutrals or 
possibly even tailwinds in 2019. Do you feel that the scaling up of 
e-commerce -- like as you and others provide that opportunity to 
consumers more aggressively, do you see 2019 as a transition year where 
you might be able to scale up enough in the established market to 
minimize or mitigate the EBITDA hit that e-commerce might represent? Or 
are we still a couple of years away from getting to that level?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: So in the market where we first started, 
which is Québec, we certainly hope the sooner the better, and our plan 
is to get there fast. I won't give you an exact date, but we are 
continuing to invest. And our plan is to get to breakeven and positive 
territory pretty soon. So hopefully, that's in 2019. And then we will 
start investing in Ontario. So we will be investing there. So we have to
 invest for our future because there is some demand for the e-commerce 
service, and we will provide it. So we have to make some investments in 
Ontario. Hopefully, the investment in Ontario will turn -- in Québec 
will turn positive in 2019, and then will turn positive in Ontario after
 a little while over there as we scale up. So I will leave it at that, 
Jim, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p> JAMES DURRAN: No, no. Understandable, Eric. And just last question 
is National Pharmacare. Now it's become a bit of a topic as we wait for 
the liberals to potentially table what they actually want to do with the
 National Pharmacare initiative, I assume, in advance as they get closer
 to the election time frame next year. Can you share with us what your 
sort of views are on the National Pharmacare conversations you've been 
involved in so far, like, do you think it's something that we need to 
understand as being a cautionary component in terms of headline risk and
 then tangibly into 2020, a negative effect of pharmacy? Or is it your 
sort of sense that where it may net out maybe generally positive for the
 industry both short term and long term?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, our pharmacy business outside of Québec
 is quite small. So I don't think for us, it's a significant or a 
material impact on the company, the impact of a potential Pharmacare on 
our Ontario business. In Québec where we are big in pharmacy, we de 
facto have already sort of a Pharmacare. It's a hybrid program, but 
everybody is covered. So I think on the script count growth that you see
 in Québec, which is healthy, I think some of it has to do with the fact
 that it's available. You're either covered with private insurance or 
you're on the public side and people are covered. So if there is a 
different fee system with National Pharmacare for the pharmacists, 
that's another issue, I won't comment on that for now. But we don't see 
it as a risk to our business. Short answer, we don't see the Pharmacare 
discussion to be a risk to the Metro business.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST, RESEARCH ANALYST, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: 
So very good tonnage growth on the food side. Would you say you're 
gaining share? Or do you think it was just a strong market given the 
great summer weather?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: We think we are holding share. We're doing 
well. We're happy with our tonnage. We're happy with our sales. But the 
numbers we see, we consider or we think we're holding share in both of 
our markets, which we think is pretty good in this competitive 
environment.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Okay. And then you talked about gross margin 
improving on the food business. Would you say that's more from a mix 
improvement? Or are you -- or does the inflation include some passing 
along of the higher costs more -- like higher operating costs and things
 like that rather than simply cost controlled inflation?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, it's mostly mix and -- the mix of our 
business and of our merchandising within the different businesses. So I 
would say, it's mostly mix. We're always trying to improve shrink. It's a
 bunch of things, Michael, as you know, but we're pleased with our 
performance on gross margin on the food side in both discount and 
conventional. Some cost increases are being passed along. Produce is a 
good example. I think we're pretty successful so far to pass on those 
cost increases, which are largely based on transport cost increases, and
 some dairy price increases, the milk price went up and some dairy 
products associated with that did go up. So we were able to pass on most
 of that.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Okay. All right. And are you able to give some 
degree of split between where the synergies are coming on food versus 
the drug side?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, we didn't want to give you precise 
numbers on that. It may vary quarter to quarter, some Coutu, some Metro 
on procurement, some Coutu on SG&amp;A. So it's going in -- to the 
benefit of both organizations. So our position is we will give you the 
synergy run rate annualized progress quarter over -- quarter after 
quarter to give you where we're at.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Okay. In Q3, you said that there was no 
contributions from synergies. And now you've got $6.6 million 
year-to-date. So was there some retroactive payments from suppliers in 
the quarter?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: That's correct. There is some, depends which 
category and which supplier, but that's right. So the $6.6 million 
refers to the period of May 11 to the end of September.</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT: And we were not -- Michael, we were not in a 
position to confirm that in Q3 because they were negotiated later and 
you should expect that similar pattern going forward. There is -- we 
expect to have some retroactive payments every time we conclude an 
agreement.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Okay. And then the tax on the Couche-Tard share 
sale, that's -- that wasn't paid yet, right, that's coming in Q1 fiscal 
'19?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes, that's right. And we expected that and we have the funds for that.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Great. Okay. And then you talked about your 
e-commerce coming in fiscal '19 for Ontario. Can you talk about maybe 
the timing around the launch? And what is the -- what were you looking 
for in Québec before you decided to launch it in Ontario? What's -- like
 why is it -- why is there a bigger gap between the 2 launches?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, it's a new business. For us, it's a new
 model. So there is a lot of learnings and process and procedures to be 
efficient. So we're a lot better than we were when we first started. So 
when we go to Ontario, hopefully, we'll be even better. So we will be in
 a better position to not invest so much. We're not going to go with 7 
stores, I can tell you that. We're going to go with a smaller number to 
start. So we're building out physically the space to do that inside 
these stores. And we'll be ready sometime in the spring to start the 
project and build it over time.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: So with a smaller number of stores will you be able to get 60%?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes. To start, we will start with a smaller 
number of stores. Our plan is still to service 60% of the GTA.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: Sorry, was that 50% or 60%?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: 60%.</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: 60%, okay. Great. And just finally, on your -- as
 far as food is concerned in The Jean Coutu sites, can you talk about 
the possibilities to expand the offering there, not just kind of switch 
over some of them, but more expand the offering in grocery, fresh food 
and maybe even milkettes?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes. So that's the kind of stuff we're going 
to be working on to determine what makes sense for the Coutu banner, the
 Coutu franchisees. So private label is one avenue where I think it's a 
better assortment. So it's not just switching one product from another, 
but perhaps having a better offer. On the fresh side, we're going to be 
careful with that. We may do some tests, but nothing to write home 
about. So Jean Coutu's stores are quite productive, high sales per 
square foot. So the space is, I think, the right size. But before you 
take something out and put something in, you've got to make the right 
decision. So we're going to do a lot of analysis before we change the 
offer. It's a good offer right now. We think there is potential to sell 
more food, but we're going to go -- we're going to go site by site, 
market by market to determine what's the best opportunity. And our 
growth...</p>
<p> MICHAEL VAN AELST: And milkettes?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes, milkettes, that's an opportunity to sell
 milkettes in drugstores, especially urban ones that have perhaps less 
food store competition around them. So yes, we're looking at that. So 
stay tuned, we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Keith Howlett from Desjardins Securities.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT, VP, CONSUMER PRODUCTS &amp; MERCHANDISING ANALYST AND
 RETAIL ANALYST, DESJARDINS SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. I 
had a question about capital spending. Could you review the capital 
budget for fiscal '19 across grocery and pharmacy?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes. Ballpark, the CapEx plan for fiscal '19 
is about $450 million, but on the retail grocery side, we see somewhere 
around $200 million. We have investments on the supply chain or the 
warehouses in Ontario. So that's going to step up in fiscal '19. The 
CapEx on the drugstore side is quite small. So we have some warehouse 
configuration investments to make in automation where the Coutu 
warehouse needs to be expanded a bit. So there's some investment on the 
DC at Coutu, but nothing like what we're going to be doing in Ontario. 
So $450 million total number. I would say the majority of that goes to 
food obviously. And within food, a good portion next year will be on 
supply chain.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT: And is there any dealer investment in the $450 million? Or is that all corporate?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: $450 million is the corporate number. On the 
retail side in Metro Québec, there is always investments or some 
remodelings done by French affiliates. So that would be on top of that.</p>
<p> FRANçOIS THIBAULT: That's right.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT: And then on the square footage growth in grocery, do 
you anticipate sort of 0 to 1%? Or can you -- what are you thinking in 
terms of square footage addition?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Well, we will be at 1% -- we will be less 
than 1% ourselves. We expect the industry to be in the same area. So our
 traditional competitors, we don't expect a significant square footage 
expansion. So the main players should be -- we think next year will be 
1% or less. There are other players, the nontraditionals, that are going
 square footage. So we keep an eye on that and they are having an 
impact. But on the overall food market, it's -- as I said in my opening 
remarks, we see it as being modest growth, which is good.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT: And I just had a question on reporting going forward.
 I presume that you're going to make Brunet part of Jean Coutu sometime 
during fiscal '19. So I'm wondering will you continue to break out Jean 
Coutu numbers separately or not?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: So the same-store sales numbers we're giving 
for drug combines Brunet and Coutu. That's the first thing I want to 
make it clear. We will disclose the Coutu performance sales and EBITDA 
for 1 year. And after that, we intend to not do that. We will continue 
to provide sales, but not the EBITDA number -- same-store sales, I mean,
 comp sales performance. After a year, we will be continuing to give you
 that for drug.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT: And so the Brunet EBITDA is not in the Coutu EBITDA, but they're in the same-store sales, is that correct?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Correct. That's correct.</p>
<p> KEITH HOWLETT: And just one last question on freight. Are you 
getting -- a, how are you handling freight costs and are you having a 
lot of your vendors come to you to say they need price increases due to 
freight or sort of where is the freight issue going, I guess, is what 
I'm trying to figure out?</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: It's clearly an element and cost pressure 
that we're having -- that our suppliers are having and that we're 
having. So yes, it's a fact of the industry. Significant transportation 
cost increases, most of it is reflecting -- is reflected in the cost of 
goods, some of that is in SG&amp;A. And as I said earlier, we have been 
successful so far to be able to pass that on. But it's a contributor to 
some of the inflation here.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
<p> ERIC RICHER LA FLèCHE: Yes. Thanks, Jessa. Okay, well, we'd like to 
thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with all
 of you again for our first quarter results, which will be held on 
January 29, 2019. Thank you.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and 
welcome to Uxin's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
 Instructions)</p>
<p> Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>
<p> I will now turn the call over to Nancy Song, Investor Relations Director of Uxin. Please go ahead.</p>
<p> NANCY SONG: Thank you, operator.</p>
<p> Hello, everyone. Welcome to Uxin's third quarter 2018 conference 
call. Today, DK, our Founder and CEO; and Zhen Zeng, our CFO, will 
discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Following the 
prepared remarks, Henry Tsai, our Head of Corporate Finance, will join 
DK and Zhen to address any questions.</p>
<p> Before we start, I would like to remind you that our statements 
today will contain forward-looking statements that we'll make under the 
safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current 
knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and 
uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially 
from our expectations. Uxin does not undertake any obligation to update 
any forward-looking statements, except as required under applicable 
laws. For more information about the potential risks and uncertainties, 
please refer to the company's filings with the SEC.</p>
<p> With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, DK, please.</p>
<p> DAI KUN, CHAIRMAN OF BOD &amp; CEO, UXIN LIMITED: Thank you, Nancy.</p>
<p> Hello, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong performance
 for the third quarter of 2018. Our focus on providing a broad selection
 of used cars, digital transparency and a one-stop solution continues to
 translate into an outstanding user experience and a growing demand from
 both consumers and dealers.</p>
<p> We again delivered a robust top line growth with revenue up 60% 
year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. This 
reflects increases in the transaction volume number of loans facilitated
 and the take rate during the quarter.</p>
<p> Our 2C business remained the primary growth driver for the business.
 The revenue for our 2C business, including both transaction 
facilitation and the loan facilitation, increased by 109% 
year-over-year. Transaction volume for our 2C business reached 129,000 
used cars, up 53% year-over-year. This is equivalent to GMV of RMB 10.2 
billion.</p>
<p> Our transaction facilitation take rate was 1.4% compared to 0.7% in 
Q3 last year. The increase reflects the strength of our brand and the 
pricing power as well as the increasing traction of our service among 
user. As a result, our transaction facilitation revenue increased by 
165% year-over-year during the quarter.</p>
<p> Loan facilitation continued to be important for consumers and 
increased together with the growth in volume of transactions. The 
average service fee rate for loan facilitation increased to 6.9%, up 
from 6.1% a year ago with loan facilitation revenue growing by 96% 
year-over-year. The increase in service fee rates was mainly due to the 
ongoing diversification of our loan products.</p>
<p> We also enhanced our risk management through analysis of the large 
volume of transaction and user behavior data collected on our platform, 
as well as enhancement in our pre- and post-financing management 
capabilities. This led to an improvement in our M3+ delinquency rate to 
1.43% as of the end of Q3 2018, from 1.53% as of the end of Q2 this 
year.</p>
<p> Now let me share some updates on key areas of our operations before 
Zhen gives greater detail on our financial performance shortly.</p>
<p> First, enriching selection of used cars. Uxin is dedicated to 
providing consumers with the broadest selection of used cars from 
different regions across China. At the end of the third quarter, we had 
290,000 cars available to be purchased real-time via our network.</p>
<p> Second, digital transparency. We are also committed to setting the 
industry benchmark for transparency by standardizing and digitalizing 
used car inspections and increasing the accuracy of used car evaluation.
 Through our standardized and proprietary inspection process and the 
recently-launched VR-enabled online car viewing experience, we 
differentiated ourselves by bringing a more professional and interactive
 experience to our users. In addition, our Manhattan pricing system 
analyzes data from over 5.8 million car inspections and 1.8 million 
transactions to accurately estimate used car values. This enables us to 
reduce information gap between sellers and the buyers and bring much 
greater price transparency.</p>
<p> Last but not least, we continue to focus on making Uxin a one-stop 
service platform. On top of offering a broad, cross-regional selection 
of used cars, we are also able to provide car financing options, arrange
 title transfer and used car delivery with the support of our service 
and fulfilment network. This full suite of offerings enable us to 
deliver a seamless and comprehensive used car purchasing experience on 
one platform.</p>
<p> With our determination to enhance value propositions for our users, 
we are confident that we can extend our market leadership in China's 
underserved used car market and build a sustainable business over the 
long term.</p>
<p> Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Zhen Zeng, to talk through our financials.</p>
<p> ZHEN ZENG, CFO, UXIN LIMITED: Well, thanks, DK. Hello, everyone. 
Thanks for joining us. Now let me walk you through our financial 
performance in the third quarter of 2018. Note that all numbers are in 
RMB unless otherwise stated. Also, please note that some numbers I refer
 to are non-GAAP. You can find a reconciliation of these numbers in our 
earnings release.</p>
<p> In the third quarter, total revenues increased by 60% to RMB 864 
million from RMB 541 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increase 
was primarily due to the increase in the transaction volume, amount of 
loans facilitated and the take rate, particularly from our 2C business.</p>
<p> Drilling down to our 2C and 2B business units.</p>
<p> 2C transaction facilitation revenue was RMB 139 million, an increase
 of 165% from RMB 52 million in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due
 to a 53% increase in the transaction volume and a 35% increase in GMV 
of used cars sold through our 2C business. Our 2C transaction 
facilitation take rate was 1.4% in the third quarter of 2018, up from 
0.7% in the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> 2C loan facilitation revenue increased by 96% to RMB 474 million, 
primarily driven by the increase in the volume and amount of loans 
facilitated. Our service fee rate was 6.9% during the quarter, up from 
6.1% in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in service fee rates was
 primarily driven by the ongoing diversification of our loan products 
with more tenure and down-payment options. The attach rate of loan 
facilitation services remained relatively stable at around 46% in the 
quarter.</p>
<p> In terms of our 2B business, our 2B transaction facilitation revenue
 reached RMB 191 million, representing an increase of 21% year-over-year
 primarily due to the increase in take rate. Our take rate for 2B 
transaction facilitation was 4.5% in the third quarter of 2018, up from 
3.2% in the third quarter of 2017. As we noted last quarter, we have 
adopted a different approach to serving consumers with car selling 
needs. Excluding this impact, our B2B business achieved 18.6% 
year-on-year growth in the number of transactions.</p>
<p> Cost of revenues increased by 56% year-over-year to RMB 305 million 
for third quarter of 2018 compared to RMB 196 million in the same period
 last year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number
 of the personnel engaged in our car inspection, quality control, 
customer service and aftersales services as well as the cost of title 
transfer, registration and fulfilment expenses, which was in line with 
the increase in our transaction volume.</p>
<p> Gross margin was 65% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 64% in the same period last year.</p>
<p> Total operating expenses was RMB 1,102 million. Non-GAAP operating 
expenses, excluding share-based compensation, was RMB 1,025 million, 
representing a 40% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p> Sales and marketing expenses increased by 40% year-over-year to RMB 
755 million compared to RMB 541 million in the same period last year. 
The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of 
employees, which was partially offset by a decrease in the branding 
expenses.</p>
<p> - Branding expenses decreased to RMB 211 million.</p>
<p> - We also saw an increase in conversion efficiency, which reflected 
more accurate consumer targeting and the ramp-up of sales consultants' 
productivity.</p>
<p> - As a result of increasing operating leverage, sales and marketing 
expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses, as a percentage 
of total revenue decreased to 88% during the quarter, from 100% in the 
third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> G&amp;A expenses increased by 3% year-over-year to RMB 266 million 
in the third quarter of 2018 from RMB 259 million in the same period 
last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in 
the number of employees and office expenses, which was partially offset 
by the decrease in share-based compensation expenses.</p>
<p> - G&amp;A expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation
 expenses, was RMB 190 million, representing 22% of total revenues in 
the quarter, compared to 23% in the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> The R&amp;D expenses increased by 68% year-over-year to RMB 82 
million in the third quarter of 2018 from RMB 49 million in the 
corresponding period last year. The increase was primarily due to the 
increase in salary and benefit expenses of employees engaged in research
 and development as well as the expenses related to the development of 
our IT business.</p>
<p> - R&amp;D expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation
 expenses, were RMB 82 million, representing 9% of total revenues in the
 quarter, at the same level of quarter 3 of 2017.</p>
<p> We are confident that our increasing operating leverage and prudent 
approach to expense management will continue to improve our 
profitability over time.</p>
<p> Gain from the guarantee liability was RMB 2.4 million compared to a 
loss of RMB 19 million in the prior year period. The slight gain was the
 result of a relatively stable delinquency rate compared to that of the 
second quarter of 2018.</p>
<p> Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2018 was RMB 543 
million, compared to a loss of RMB 523 million in the prior year period.
 Non-GAAP loss from operations, which excludes the share-based 
compensation expenses, was RMB 466 million compared to RMB 385 million 
in the same period last year. Non-GAAP loss from operations as a 
percentage of total revenues was 54% in the third quarter of 2018, 
decreased from 71% in third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> The change in fair value of derivative liabilities was nil in the 
third quarter of 2018 compared to a loss of RMB 238 million in the same 
period last year. We no longer see any impact of derivative liabilities 
as the preferred shares were converted into ordinary shares at the time 
of IPO.</p>
<p> Net loss in quarter 3 2018 was RMB 594 million compared to a net 
loss of RMB 766 million in the prior year period. The narrowed net loss 
was primarily due to the decrease in loss from the fair value change of 
derivative liabilities.</p>
<p> Non-GAAP adjusted net loss, which excludes share-based compensation 
expenses, was RMB 517 million in the quarter compared to a loss of RMB 
390 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss as a 
percentage of total revenues was 60% in quarter 3 of 2018, decrease from
 72% in the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> Now turning to our cash position.</p>
<p> As of September 30, 2018, Uxin had cash and cash equivalents of RMB 
677 million compared to RMB 292 million as of December 31, 2017. The 
company also had restricted cash of RMB 1,838 million compared to RMB 
1,617 million as of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p> Finally, turning to guidance.</p>
<p> For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect the total revenues to be 
in the range of RMB 1.02 billion to RMB 1.06 billion. This forecast 
reflects the company's current and preliminary views on the market and 
operational conditions, which are subject to change.</p>
<p> This concludes our prepared remarks.</p>
<p> NANCY SONG: Thank you, Mr. Zeng. Operator, we'd like now open the call for questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p>
<p> Our first question comes from the line of Eddy Wang from Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p> EDDY WANG, RESEARCH ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I
 have 3 questions. The first one is about the 2C business take rate. We 
have witnessed a quite impressive increasing trend of 2C take rate this 
year. Especially for the third quarter, take rate increased around 20 
bps sequentially, while the volume growth was also higher than that of 
the year's second quarter. So will you please give more details about 
how you are managing to achieve this and how we could expect the take 
rate trend in the fourth quarter and onwards? This is my first question.
 And my second question is about the delinquency rate. The third quarter
 delinquency rate also improved 10 bps versus the second quarter. So 
also, I would like to management give more details about how we can 
achieve this and how is the trend in the next few quarters. On a 
separate note, I noticed that the restricted cash balance at third 
quarter end actually are quite similar at the -- versus the second 
quarter end. So I'm just wondering if there is any -- I mean, the -- our
 auto finance partners have lowered their requirements in terms of the 
deposit as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance we facilitated. 
So basically which means that if there's any -- the more favorable terms
 from this -- our auto finance partners. This is second one. And the 
last question is about the overall market because we have noticed that 
the new car industry demand in the third quarter has been weak. So do 
you expect any negative impact from this weak demand to the used car 
industry in the short term? Although so far, I think our third quarter 
volume growth and fourth quarter guidance seems quite immune from this 
weak demand in China, but just want to hear your thoughts about any -- 
the -- thoughts of the weak new car auto demand, the impact to the used 
car industry.</p>
<p> DAI KUN: Okay. Thank you, Eddy. This is DK. And all right, we get 
all your questions. I think I would like to take your question 3 first 
and just -- okay. Is that okay? I turn into Chinese and Henry will help 
me to translate. Okay.</p>
<p> (foreign language)</p>
<p> HENRY TSAI: Sure. Thanks, Eddy. I think, number one, that was a 
great question. New cars obviously saw an impact on the broader economy 
in Q3. For the first time we saw new cars worldwide trend actually 
declined in 2018. Now obviously, as we look at our business in used 
cars, we feel that used car environment is a lot more constructive than 
new cars, especially when a lot of consumers are very focused on 
affordability, which actually plays to used car strength.</p>
<p> DAI KUN: Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> HENRY TSAI: And then in terms of our own business, we feel that our 
model is unique in a way whereby we are providing users with a great 
used car purchasing experience by moving people's buying behavior from 
offline to online. So now actually we are accelerating our own growth. 
And also with our strength and scalability of business model, we 
continue to expand our market share. So we feel that not only is used 
cars more constructive than in broader -- new car environment, we will 
continue to outgrow the broader used car market as well.</p>
<p> ZHEN ZENG: Okay, Eddy. It's Michael here. So I would like to address
 your questions on take rate and delinquency rate and also the cash. So 
for the 2C take rate drivers, in this quarter, our 2C transaction 
facilitation take rate was 1.4% compared to 0.7% in the same period last
 year. This is mainly because we have been enhancing our service 
capabilities to better cater to car buyers' different needs. This also 
demonstrates consumers' higher appreciation of Uxin's unique value 
proposition. That is, a broader car selection enabled by the 
cross-regional transactions and a better car condition and the price 
transparency and one-stop services. With this integrated offering, we 
have been able to gain greater pricing power while increasing scale. 
This also enable us to deliver more value to dealers as we help them 
increase inventory turnover efficiency. And for the loan, our service 
fee rate for our loan facilitation also increased to 6.9% in this 
quarter compared to 6.1% in the third quarter last year. This is mainly 
because we provided more diversification selection of loan products to 
meet various consumer needs and continue to optimize our loan product 
offering mix. And for the long run, we are confident that we can 
continue to increase our 2C take rate by adding more value-added service
 and optimizing our product mix.</p>
<p> And for the delinquency rate improvement, so in this quarter, our 
M3+ delinquency rate continued to improve as we are enhancing our risk 
management capability as well as the pre- and post-financing management 
capability. We're also taking a prudent approach to credit assessment, 
especially when entering new fields. As China's largest used car 
transaction platform, Uxin has aggregated massive transaction and user 
behavior data as well as used car condition data. We have a deeply 
understanding not only of the vehicles, but also for the people, which 
gives us unique advantages in evaluating used car residual value and 
assessing user creditworthiness of risk profile. As we're expanding our 
used car financing business, we have also accumulated rich experience in
 risk management and kept optimizing our pre- and post-financing 
management capabilities. So we will continue to invest and strengthen 
our risk management system and strive to enhance credit performance to 
loan facilitation through our platform.</p>
<p> ZHEN ZENG: For your last question for the restricted cash. Our 
financing partner has been pleased with the credit performance of our 
user and our collateral management capability. As a result, we have been
 able to negotiate a better term with them, such as deposit values 
required to hold advanced escrow account. We are confident that as they 
learn more about our platform and get more confident of our track 
record, we will be able to continue to improve the terms. In addition, 
we are looking for a new way to work together with financing partners 
that will enhance our liquidation -- liquidity position. We will have 
more updates for you in the coming quarters.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) As there are no questions at this time, I'll hand the call back to Nancy. Please continue.</p>
<p> NANCY SONG: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call and for 
your continued support for Uxin. We look forward to speaking to you 
again in the near future. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. 
Welcome toCopa Holdings Third Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator 
Instructions) Asa reminder, this call is being webcast and recorded on 
November 15,2018.</p>
<p>Now I will turn the conference over to Raul Pascual, Director ofInvestor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
<p><b>RAUL PASCUAL, DIRECTOR OF IR, COPA HOLDINGS, S.A.:</b> Thank you, 
Brian,and welcome, everyone, to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining
 ustoday are Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Holding; and Jose Montero, 
ourCFO.</p>
<p>First, Pedro will start with our third quarter highlights, followedby
 Jose, who will discuss our financial results. Immediately after,we will
 open up the call for questions from analysts. Copa Holdings'financial 
reports have been prepared in accordance with InternationalFinancial 
Reporting Standards. In today's call, we will discussnon-IFRS financial 
measures. A reconciliation of the non-IFRS to IFRSfinancial measures can
 be found in our earnings release, which hasbeen posted on the company's
 website, copa.com.</p>
<p>Our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, 
notlimited to historical facts, that reflect the company's 
currentbeliefs, expectations and intentions regarding future events 
andresults. These forward-looking statements involve risks 
anduncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materiallyand
 are based on assumptions that are subject to change. Many ofthese are 
discussed in our annual report filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Pedro Heilbron.</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, COPA HOLDINGS, S.A.:</b> Thank
 you,Raul. Good morning to all, and thanks for participating in our 
thirdquarter earnings call. First, I want to recognize all of 
ourcoworkers for their efforts during the quarter. Their 
ongoingdedication and commitment keeps us at the forefront of Latin 
Americanaviation.</p>
<p>As you can see in our third quarter release, we confronted a numberof
 challenges during the quarter. On the expense side, we had morethan $48
 million of additional cost due to higher fuel prices. And onthe revenue
 front, we faced a deteriorating demand environment,mainly driven by 
economic and currency weakness in Brazil andArgentina. This is not 
exclusive to Copa, as international IATA BSVsales for the entire 
industry in these 2 markets measured in U.S.dollars were down about 25% 
and 40%, respectively, for the quarter.</p>
<p>Most of the -- rest of our network was not affected 
year-over-year.However, we were not able to compensate for the 
additional fuelexpense. We firmly believe this is a temporary situation 
and areconfident in the long-term value and potential of this market, 
thestrength of our business model and our ability to return to 
highermargins. Among the main highlights for the quarter, passenger 
trafficgrew 4.8% year-over-year on a capacity growth of 6.6%. This 
resultedin an 84.3% load factor, 1.4 percentage points lower 
year-over-year.Yields came in at $0.116 or 3.3% lower than in the third 
quarter of2017. Unit revenues or RASM decreased 4.2% year-over-year to 
$0.101.</p>
<p>On the cost side, CASM came in at $0.90, 4.3% higher 
year-over-yeardue to higher fuel costs. However, ex-fuel unit cost came 
in at $0.06or 5.5% lower year-over-year due to the timing of certain 
events andcost-reduction efforts. The resulting operating margins came 
in at11%. On the operational front, Copa earnings delivered an 
on-timeperformance of 88.3% and a completion factor of 99.8%, again 
amongstthe best in the world.</p>
<p>Turning now to the rest of 2018 and 2019. Demand weakness in 
Braziland Argentina continues to put significant pressure on our 
unitrevenues, also affecting other parts of our network such as 
theCaribbean and North America. As a result, we are adjusting 
ourguidance to reflect our performance in the third quarter across 
aweaker fourth quarter forecast. We are also adjusting our capacity 
inthe affected markets, especially during low season. For the 
fourthquarter of 2018, we're reducing our Brazil capacity year-over-year
 byabout 10% and reducing our growth in Argentina from 20% to about 10%.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, we have seen some encouraging signs,decreasing
 oil prices and stability in both the Brazilian real andArgentinian 
peso. There also seems to be more optimistic andregarding the economic 
prospects for both countries. While there isstill a long way to go, and 
at this point, we do not want to be toooptimistic. From what we can see 
right now, we will still be dealingwith our top unit revenue environment
 at least into the first quarterof 2019.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, we continue making progress on many 
fronts.As you have seen in our results, our unit cost, excluding fuel 
are aslow as they ever been, and we continue looking for further 
savingopportunities. With the production of the 737 MAX 9, we also 
launchedour new business class product DREAMS for a longer flights, 
whichshould help us increase the yields in the front of the cabin in 
thoseroutes. We continue to make progress in ancillary revenues 
andloyalty program, including seat assignment, second back seat 
inselected markets and the selling of miles and upgrades among others.We
 also have made significant progress in deploying new technologytools.</p>
<p>As of last month, our call center agents are using the new 
passengerservice interface, which among other benefits allows us to 
sellancillary products for the first time through this channel. We 
expectthis to enhance and accelerate our ancillary revenue performance.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we'll also have this capability in at least 
4airports and expect to have full deployment in 2019. In summary, 
wecontinue working to strengthen our business model and further 
ourability to produce premium margins.</p>
<p>Turning now to our fleet. After receiving our last 2 737-800s 
andreturning a leased Embraer-190 in the first half of the year, webegan
 taking delivery of our first 3 737 MAX 9s, 1 in August, 1 inOctober and
 the other in November. We expect to receive 2 more duringthe next few 
weeks to end the year with a consolidated fleet of 106aircrafts. As for 
our previously published fleet trend, we expect toreceive 8 Boeing 737 
MAX 9s in 2019. However, we're also announcingthat after a review of our
 demand expectation and long-term fleet andnetwork plan, we have decided
 to further reduce our 100-seat aircraftfleet, and thus we expect to 
retire up to 6 Embraer-190, 5 of whichwill leave next year.</p>
<p>So we now expect to end 2019 with 109 aircrafts, 3 more than 
2018.This decision leads to slower 2019 growth, but more 
importantly,higher long-term efficiency and structurally lower unit cost
 leadingto higher profits. Jose will give more details on this 
transaction.</p>
<p>Regarding our network, in July, we started 3 new flights Fortalezaand
 Salvador, our 8th and 9th destinations in Brazil and 
Bridgetown,Barbados, our 16th destination in the Caribbean. We also 
announced 2new destinations for the end of the year, Puerto Vallarta in 
Mexicoand Salta in Argentina, both starting in December. Although 
thetiming may not be ideal, we believe in the long-term value of 
theseadditions. By the end of the year, Copa will provide service to 
80destinations in 32 countries, in North, Central, South America andthe 
Caribbean, by far the most complete and efficient network 
forintra-America travel.</p>
<p>On the operational front, we continue delivering 
industry-leadingresults. We're very proud of the efforts that have more 
than 9,000coworkers put in day after day to place us among the most 
on-timeairlines in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm glad to report that Wingo, although a very small 2% 
ofour revenues continues to do better than expected, both 
operationallyand financially. In fact, during 2019, we will be swapping 
their 4737-700s for 4 737-800s, which will further lower their unit 
costsand increase profitability. Furthermore, we expect to transfer 
afifth 737-800 to the Wingo fleet and most likely based it in Panama.</p>
<p>To summarize, we expect global unit revenues for the rest of the 
yearand into the first part of 2019 based mostly on yield softness 
inBrazil and Argentina. We're being proactive and taking steps 
tomoderate our growth to accommodate these market conditions. Our 
teamcontinues to deliver world-class operational results, including 
oneof the world's highest on-time performance. We continue 
deliveringefficiencies and savings, which have further lowered 
ourindustry-leading unit costs. We're also continue focusing on 
revenueopportunities, including ancillary initiatives that are aimed 
atstrengthening our results.</p>
<p>Lastly, we're as confident as ever in our business model and 
ourfinancial strength. Even during a challenging year, we 
continuedelivering a great product, leading unit cost and 
double-digitmargins, making us the best position to consistently 
deliverindustry-leading results, especially once the market conditions 
inour region normalize.</p>
<p>Now I'll turn it over to Jose, who will go over our financial resultsin more detail.</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO, CFO, COPA HOLDINGS, S.A.:</b> Thank you, Pedro. 
Goodmorning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, I want 
tostart by acknowledging our great Copa team for all their 
achievementsduring a challenging quarter. During the third quarter, we 
grewcapacity by 6.6% year-over-year, while revenue passenger 
milesincreased 4.8% year-over-year, which resulted in a consolidated 
loadfactor of 84.3%, a 1.4 percentage point decrease versus Q3 2017.</p>
<p>Yields were also weaker coming in 3.3% below last year, 
asyear-over-year decline was mostly driven by the continued weakness 
inthe Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. Combined sales in these 
2currencies represented about 28% of our total sales in 2017. DuringQ3 
2017, our RASM was $0.106 and in Q3 2018, it came in at 
$0.101Consolidated revenues increased 2.1% year-over-year to over 
$672million.</p>
<p>On the expense side, our third quarter operating expenses 
increased11.2% year-over-year on the 6.6% capacity growth, which 
resulted inour cost per available seat mile increasing 4.3% to 
$0.09,specifically as a function of higher jet fuel prices.</p>
<p>For the quarter, our effective all-in fuel price averaged $2.20 
pergallon, an increase of almost 32% versus $1.82 per gallon that 
weaveraged in Q3 2017. Our total fuel expense for the quarter was 
$57.2million above Q3 2017, of which $48.6 million are related to the 
fuelprice increase.</p>
<p>However, we were able to offset some of this increase with 
ourcontinued savings initiatives. Specifically, we have already 
achievedthe initial results of our corporate plan to reduce our 
yearlyexpenses by $50 million and have decided to expand the program 
topursue additional opportunities in the range of $15 million per 
year.For the third quarter, our cost per available seat mile, 
excludingfuel, ex fuel CASM came in at 5.5% lower year-over-year, coming
 downfrom $0.063 in Q3 2017 to $0.06 in this quarter.</p>
<p>For the full year, we expect our ex fuel CASM to come in at a 
verystrong $0.062, one of the lowest for any full-service 
carrier.Consolidated operating earnings for the quarter came in 38% 
lower at$74.3 million, resulting in an operating margin of 11%, 
7.3percentage points lower than the 18.3% generated in Q3 2017.</p>
<p>Looking at nonoperating income and expense, the third 
quartergenerated a net nonoperating expense of $5.3 million compared 
to$900,000 reported for Q3 2017, which included a $2.9 million gainfrom 
the mark-to-market of derivative contracts open at that time. Interms of
 net results, net earnings for the quarter came in at $57.7million or 
earnings per share of $1.36, 45% lower than the earningsper share 
reported in Q3 2017.</p>
<p>Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with a verystrong
 financial position. Assets totaled $4.4 billion, owners'equity totaled 
$2 billion, debt plus capitalized leases totaled $2billion and our 
adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at a verystrong 1.6x, by far 
the lowest in our peer group. We closed thequarter with approximately 
$1.2 billion in debt, more than 60% ofwhich is fixed with the blended 
rate including fixed and includingrate debt of approximately 3.4%.</p>
<p>In regards to cash, short- and long-term investments, we closed 
thequarter with $916 million. Our cash balance at the end of the 
quarterrepresents approximately 36% of last 12 months revenues.</p>
<p>In terms of fleet, we received our first MAX 9 during the 
quarter,followed by our second and third MAX 9s in the months of October
 andNovember and expect to receive 2 more aircraft during the 
fourthquarter, to end the year with a total of 106 aircraft. It 
isimportant to note that we have already secured the financing for 
allthe aircraft we will take delivery of in 2018 and 2019. We have 
alsomade a decision to reduce our Embraer fleet and have signed a 
letterof intent with Azorra Aviation for the sale of up to 6 
E-190aircraft, 5 of which are expected to leave our fleet during 2019.</p>
<p>The transaction will cost an impairment to the entire Embraer 
fleetgenerating a one-time noncash adjustment of around $163 million 
thatwill be recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018. The departure 
ofthese 6 aircraft will represent an estimated yearly benefit to 
ournetwork of over $10 million. This transaction also is a reflection 
ofthe embedded flexibility in our fleet plan that we have discussedmany 
times before, and this flexibility allows us to adjust ourcapacity to a 
current economic environment.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors 
hasratified the fourth quarterly dividend of $0.87 per share to be 
paidon December 14 to all shareholders of record as of November 30.</p>
<p>So to summarize, the third quarter performance was affected by 
theweakness in some of the currencies in the region as well as 
theincrease in the price of jet fuel. However, we continue to 
deliverindustry-leading unit costs, and we continue pursuing 
ourcost-savings initiatives. Our network continues to being the 
mostconvenient for travel within the Americas with world-class 
operatingindicators. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in 
theindustry, and we continue to return value to our shareholders. 
We'realso updating our guidance for 2018 based on our expectations for 
theremainder of the year. We're maintaining our capacity growth in 
termsof ASMs at approximately 8%. And given the continued softness in 
theyield environment, mainly driven by the weakness in currencies 
inBrazil and Argentina as well as the current expectation for 
fuelprices, we now expect our full year operating margin to come in 
atapproximately 12%.</p>
<p>Our 2018 full year guidance is based on the following 
assumptions:load factor of approximately 84%; RASM of approximately 
$0.104; CASMex-fuel of approximately $0.062; and higher effective fuel 
price pergallon, including into-plane of approximately $2.35. Although 
thereis still very limited visibility into 2019 and there has been 
recentvolatility in the price of fuel and in the regional currencies, 
we'realso providing preliminary guidance for 2019 based on our 
operationalplan and expectations for our travel demand. In terms of 
capacity,ASMs are expected to grow by approximately 3%, and we are 
assumingcontinued weakness in the regional economies during the first 
half ofthe year and a moderate recovery during the second half. 
Therefore,operating margin is expected in the range of 11% to 13%. Our 
2019preliminary full year guidance is based on the following 
assumptions:CASM ex-fuel of approximately $0.062 and an effective fuel 
price pergallon, including $0.27 of into-plane of approximately $2.35. 
Thankyou.</p>
<p>And with that, we'll open the call to some questions.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> (Operator Instructions) And our first question will comefrom the line of Josh Milberg with Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p><b>JOSHUA MILBERG, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 SoI'll just go with one question and my question is on your 
guided$0.062 CASM ex-fuel, the number for 2019. I realized, of course, 
thatinflation is a factor, but just wanted to understand why that 
numberisn't showing more improvement just given all the cost 
initiativesthat you guys have highlighted obviously in areas of 
distribution,maintenance and elsewhere and also the expansion in the 
targetedreductions in terms of savings from $50 million to $65 million, 
thatyou guys just highlighted?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Josh, this Jose here. And I -- first, I'd like 
to startby saying that our $0.062 CASM is the lowest that it's ever been
 forthis year. And so we're guiding for $0.062 for next year, 
basedmostly on the fact that our growth rate for next year is just 3%. 
Andso there is, as you know -- even though we have the initiatives 
thatyou mentioned, there is, of course, some inflation assumed in 
thereas well related to overflight fees, airport fees and just 
regularsalaries and benefit inflation. So there is some inflation 
embeddedin the $0.062 figure, and also driven by the fact that our 
growth fornext year is lower 3%.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question will come from the line of Helane Beckerwith Cowen and Company.</p>
<p><b>HELANE R. BECKER, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN ANDCOMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 I have 2 questions. First is, Pedro,when you think about the Avianca 
codeshare agreement that you guysjust signed, can you just talk about 
how you envision it working? Andin terms of percentage of seats filled, 
you're pretty full. So howmany passengers realistically do you think you
 would get? So maybe,how should we think about that? And then my other 
question is, whenyou -- you're earning the dividend, but when you think 
about yourpayout ratio is what, 40% this year, I think. Can you just 
remind usof how the Board thinks about the payout? And how we should 
thinkabout it for 2019?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Helane, this is Jose here. We'll, answer first 
thesecond question related to the dividend. Yes, our policy, our 
currentpolicy is to payout 40% of prior year's adjusted net income. So 
we --our Board has not mentioned anything about changing the process. 
Sowe will expect that, that dividend payout ratio would maintainitself. 
As you know, our company is very strong about returning valueto the 
shareholder.</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> In terms of your first question. Helane, it's 
Pedro.I think you referred to the 3 way Avianca, Copa, United JV or 
jointbusiness agreement that was announced, that has not yet being 
madeofficial. So it's still needs to -- negotiations need to 
conclude.Hopefully, that will happen before the end of the year. And 
it'sgoing to then take at least 1.5 year to get it all 
approved,especially in Panama, Colombia and the U.S. So this will -- at 
bestenter into effect towards the end of 2020, I would say. And 
itrelates mostly -- I mean, it relates only to revenues or 
trafficbetween South America or Latin America, let's say, with 
someexclusions and the U.S. and vice versa. So U.S. to Latin America.</p>
<p><b>HELANE R. BECKER:</b> Okay. No. It's okay. I just thought there 
was acomment recently that you and one of the other airlines had 
maybewith Azul had signed a codeshare agreement. And I was just kind 
ofwondering, how we should think about that? And then, the Avianca 
Ithink was very helpful.</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Right. So again, the Avianca thing is end, end
 of2020. So we will have time to talk some more about that, 
especiallyonce it's official. We recently announced a codeshare 
agreement withAzul and we know Azul is the growing airline in Brazil and
 it's --Brazil is a very important market for us. Azul also has a 
closerelationship with United. As a matter of fact, United is part 
ownerof Azul. So I think this is going to strengthen our 
connectivityinside Brazil and help the performance of our Brazilian 
network goingforward.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of DanMcKenzie with Buckingham Research.</p>
<p><b>DANIEL J. MCKENZIE, RESEARCH ANALYST, THE BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH GROUPINCORPORATED:</b>
 What -- first, I've got a couple of questions here.First, what percent 
of revenue for Copa is from the Northeast Brazilto the U.S.? And how 
should we think about the impact of that -- ofthe new nonstop find from a
 couple of Brazilian airlines with respectto the Copa revenue story?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Well, it's not significant. First thing I 
should say,Dan, is that, our service to the Northeast of Brazil 
altogether, it'sless than 1 flight per day. I think it's 6 flights per 
week or maybe7 flights per week. That's the extent of our service to the
 Northeastof Brazil to Panama, and that includes connections to 
CentralAmerica, Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S. So it's not 
verysignificant. Plus a 2/3 of our Northeast Brazil service is 
veryrecent. It's from July of this year. So we're only starting to 
buildthose markets. So there is not like we're facing a competition 
that'sgoing against very established market and that we have to now 
makeup. So -- and I would say that even though the timing for 
thatNortheast Brazil service was not ideal starting in July when 
Brazilwas in the middle of getting back, the flights were doing 
okay.Surprisingly so they're not doing so bad. Obviously, yields 
arehurting, but loads are okay and we're very, very optimistic about 
thefuture of our Northeast Brazil service.</p>
<p><b>DANIEL J. MCKENZIE:</b> Good. And with respect to Argentina, 
Pedro, I'mwondering if you could elaborate on the supply demand dynamic 
toBuenos Aires versus the rest of the country? And how that might tieto 
your confidence, that things can get better in 2019 to thecountry?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Well, first, I should say that, what has 
happened inArgentina in terms of currency devaluation, was massive. 
Argentinacurrency in the third quarter devaluated over 50% and it's 
sales --industry sales were down over 40% in the Argentina market. So 
it'svery, very massive. We also know from experience is that 
Argentinaalways comes back. So we are optimistic, medium and long-term, 
butright now, the yield environment is extremely difficult in 
Argentina.So again industry sales over 40% down, BSV IATA sales over 40%
 downin those 3 unit fares in dollars are around 30 -- 25% to 30% down. 
Imean, it's tough situation and I'm giving you numbers up to October.So 
more recently we're seeing demand in terms of load factor comingback and
 actually looking quite okay year-over-year, but yields.Again yields 
still extremely weak. And yes, Buenos Aires is holdingoff better than 
some of the other destinations.</p>
<p><b>DANIEL J. MCKENZIE:</b> Got it. Do you have an update of when 
farefamilies might get turned on? And what that contribution 
couldpotentially be as we think about the better IT behind some of 
therevenue management?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Yes. I think we're doing -- we had fallen 
behind insome of these IT tools or initiatives. And so the good thing 
withthat is that we have a lot of upside ahead of us. While all 
theirearnings have had the right IT tool for a while, that's all ahead 
ofus. So the new passenger service, a user interface that we have 
justimplemented it's allowing to us sell ancillary at the call center 
andsoon as the airport. And then your specific question is going to 
bemore towards the end of 2019. We are in the final stretch of 
anegotiating contracts for other tools that will allow us to be 
veryeffective with fare family, basically second half of 2019.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question will come from the line of Savi Syth withRaymond James.</p>
<p><b>SAVANTHI NIPUNIKA SYTH, AIRLINES ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp;ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 Just a quick question on theE-190s. Any thoughts on when those might 
come out of the system? Andhow we should think about capacity growth 
next year, in the kind ofthe first part of the year versus the second 
part of the year?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Savi, this is Jose here. The E-190s are expected
 toleave -- I think it's mostly in the first part of the year, and --but
 they will be replaced with aircrafts. So I think that most of thegrowth
 that we have for next year is actually on gauge and it isbackloaded 
towards the second half of the year. So that's kind of howthat 3% growth
 for next year is expected to pan out.</p>
<p><b>SAVANTHI NIPUNIKA SYTH:</b> That's helpful. And just on the Wingo,
 itseems like there is a favorable outlook. I wonder if you could give 
alittle bit more color there. And just, how big can Wingo get, if 
youcontinue to see good results there?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Yes. We are -- we've been very conservative 
andcareful with Wingo, and we're picking that one day at a time or maybe
 1 month or 1 quarter at a time. So the next step is that we'regoing to 
upgauge from 700 to 800, that's going to make their unitcost much more 
effective and it's going to have a nice impact to theprofitability 
potential. And as mentioned, a [5th] aircraft, which isabout 20% 
capacity, which we're going to probably bases in Panama.There are a few 
markets, and it's going to fly. We do feelinterchange is going to fly 
throughout their network, but it's goingto probably based at the 
secondary airport they serve in Panama. Andagain, we're going by steps. 
How big can Wingo get? It depends onmany things. It depends on the 
market, on capacity from everyone. Wewant to have specific plans, and 
we'll just be very opportunisticwith the airlines.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of AlejandroZamacona with Crédit Suisse.</p>
<p>ALEJANDRO ZAMACONA URQUIZA, RESEARCH ANALYST, CRéDIT SUISSE 
AG,RESEARCH DIVISION: So regarding the correction of the previous 
annualfinancial statements, I'm considering the reduction of the 
previousdepreciation expenses. What can we expect going forward?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Yes. So look we -- just to give a little bit 
ofbackground there, as far as -- as part of our IFRS 16 adoptionprocess,
 we found an error in the way that we did the accruals formaintenance on
 owned aircraft. And most of the correction is fromyears prior to 2015 
and (inaudible) basically back in 2009, when wemigrated from U.S. GAAP 
to IFRS. And as you saw in our statement, youhave an increase in the 
years between 2015 and 2017, it was around$15 million for those 3 years.
 We expect going forward that theimpact to the DNA line is going to be 
lower than that, and it isembedded into our full year 2019 guidance. 
When you take this changein accrual policy together with some of the 
other items that we areannouncing like the E-190 and the incoming 
aircraft, and I don't knowoverall basis it's a -- it's not material or 
not significant in theoverall CASM ex of the company. So overall, we 
don't expect it tochange going forward the CASM of the company.</p>
<p><b>ALEJANDRO ZAMACONA URQUIZA:</b> Okay. And just a second question, 
if Imay. And so regarding the jet fuel provided in the 2019 guidance 
whatwould be the implicit price for the Brent that you're expecting in?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> In terms of Brent, so we got, I think $2.08 jet 
fuelassumption for next year , where we got in terms of jet, and 
that'saround $72 WTI. Brent and -- about WTI $66 per barrel.</p>
<p><b>ALEJANDRO ZAMACONA URQUIZA:</b> So it's $66 for Brent and...</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> No, it's only $72 for Brent and WTI is $66, 
around $66.There's been a lot of volatility on in terms of the crack 
spread inrecent months. So that's, I think, an item that we have to take
 intoaccount as well, when converting from crude into jet fuel. And so 
Ithink that the good way of looking at it is $2.08 per gallon jet 
fuelassumption, excluding into-plane, right. And as I mentioned in 
myscript, we have an assumption of $0.27 per gallon of into-plane aswell
 in our guidance for next year.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of StephenTrent with Citi.</p>
<p><b>STEPHEN TRENT, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION:</b> 
Just onequestion from me, also accounting related. When we think about 
nextyear's implementation of IFRS 16, what's the indication so to 
speak,with respect to where you guys might capitalize on leases given 
thatsome of your leases are pretty long tenure, but you've also got 
ayoung fleet. So any indication would be helpful?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Steve, it's a great question. IFRS 16, which is a
 leasestandard is coming in line on the year 2019. We're still working 
onthe adoption of the standard. It's a pretty complex sort of 
standardthat the worldwide is being implemented this year. Our 
CASMassumption for the year of $0.062, assumes already the 
implementationof the standard. And as a matter of fact from the balance 
sheetstandpoint, we are envisioning the balance sheet -- once 
youcapitalize the leases, they -- I mean, they again very 
preliminarilybecause we're still implementing the standard. But we are 
seeing thatthe capitalized lease is -- are going to be coming in at a 
lower ratethan the 7x than what, kind of as unusual for the market. So 
that'skind of our preliminary assessment of this, but will have 
moreinformation on that in our Q4 earnings call, once we complete 
theimplementation.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of DuanePfennigwerth with Evercore.</p>
<p><b>RAYMOND WILLIAM WONG, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES,RESEARCH DIVISION:</b>
 This is actually Ray on for Duane. Your firstguidance seems to imply 
unit revenue down roughly 7% in 4Q, do youthink you could break that out
 between how much of that is beingdriven by Argentina, and how much of 
that is Brazil?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Yes. Ray, this is Jose here. It's essentially 
--basically most of it is related to Brazil and Argentina indeed. Bothof
 them are on a unit revenue basis, down on a year-over-year 
basis,double-digit range. So the rest of the network, there is 
essentiallyflat here, some of them, they are slightly down, but the big 
driversthere are either Brazil and Argentina or influenced by the fleet 
ofBrazil and Argentina. So I'd say it's most of it is related to these2 
markets that are originating in nature for us in terms ofpassengers.</p>
<p><b>RAYMOND WILLIAM WONG:</b> And on a brighter note, when markets are youseeing improvement?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Well, I think that new South America markets 
areperforming reasonably well. And so yes, there's some markets outthere
 that are still doing well. So I think what I'm saying is that,the big 
downturn is encapsulated into kind of [indiscernible]especially Brazil 
and Argentina.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of MichaelLinenberg with Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST:</b> This is [Kush] on for Mike. Just had 
2questions here. First, could you help us just quantify thesynergistic 
benefits and the timing around the codeshare youannounced last week with
 Azul. I'm trying to understand whether itmight help mitigate some of 
the yield weakness you anticipate intothe first half of -- first half of
 the year in Brazil, next year?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Okay. This is Pedro. It's always hard to 
predict,that it's always going to be positive. It's better feed. It's 
moreeffective feed. And again, it's more about revenue synergy. 
It'ssomething that's really difficult to predict. It has started and 
it'snot something that we factor in our numbers. It's always an 
upside,but we don't really have a specific projection for it. It's 
somethingmore kind of an aftereffect analysis that we do, knowing that 
thereis really no downside to implementing a codeshare, especially 
withthe (inaudible) vast network in a country that's very important 
forus. So the cost of doing so is so small that, they would 
basicallylook at the -- how the 2 networks come together. We build up at
 thepotential benefit, but we don't really make any projections. We 
justwait to see what happen. So hard for us to predict. We know 
it'sgoing to be positive.</p>
<p><b>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST:</b> Great. And then, given some of the changes youdiscussed around on the fleet plan, how should we think about CapExnext year?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> So our CapEx for next year, I'd say, on a total 
basisit's about $600 million, of which cash CapEx is around $200 
million.So I think that's a good way of looking at it.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our next question will come from the line of PedroPascoal with JPMorgan.</p>
<p>PEDRO PASCOAL, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION:A
 quick one, I think, for Jose. Could you share with us whatassumption 
are you using for your next year guidance in terms ofcurrency for Brazil
 and Argentina, the average spot prices?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Yes. I'd say that the assumption in general 
terms isthat the currencies are going to remain, in the case of Brazil, 
sortof flattish. I think that indicates Argentina, we're still are 
notseeing a recovery. So it is very, very hard to determine if therewill
 be a recovery, what, the way that we're framing it is that 
we'reassuming a from a unit revenue basis, still a drop in unit 
revenuesand then low to mid-single digits on a percent basis for the 
firsthalf and then a slight recovery in the low single digits for 
thesecond half of the year. And so the other aspect that's important 
tomention, related to the currencies is that we saw the big trough inthe
 currency exchange rate, back about -- let's call it, 1.5 monthago. And 
those sales that were made 1 month, 1.5 month ago areinfluencing the 
fourth quarter and the very early part of 2019. So alot of that is 
embedded in the guidance. So what I mean by this isthat there is a lag 
between the exchange rate at one particularmoment and how that 
translates into revenues.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> And our last question will come from the line of DanMcKenzie with Buckingham Research.</p>
<p><b>DANIEL J. MCKENZIE:</b> Actually, my question follows up on those 
last 2.With respect to the non-field cost guide for 2019, can you remind
 uswhat percent of the costs are affected by swings in foreign 
exchange?And I guess, what I'm getting at it, if we see a 
materialstrengthening in either the Argentina peso or Brazilian real, 
I'mjust wondering how that might impact your non-field cost outlook 
fornext year?</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> Yes, Dan. About -- I want to say about 2/3 of 
our costsare in U.S. dollar and the rest are in foreign currencies. But 
themajority of that 1/3 is in the Colombian peso. So it isn't really 
--you don't have a significant cost base in the Brazil and Argentina 
---- or Argentina.</p>
<p><b>DANIEL J. MCKENZIE:</b> Got it. And then just kind of following up
 onhere. It seems like there has been some volatility and kind of 
therecent demand data, it seems like it could be tied to the electionsin
 perhaps U.S. and Brazil. And so I'm just wondering if you kind oflook 
at the revenue outlook to the end of the year, whether thatoutlook 
flatlines the recent leg down at least seems visible on thepublicly 
available data? Or is a temporary blip? And I'm just kind ofwondering, 
how you're thinking about holiday demand this year? Justtrying to get 
some perspective around kind of the full year guide asit pertains in the
 fourth quarter here?</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Dan, it's Pedro. Let me make a few comments 
and thenlet Jose also add. But -- so our Q4 -- our fourth quarter 
revenueprojections, I think, as Jose alluded to, are based 
on[indiscernible] sales that were made in the middle of the 
currencycrisis in Brazil and Argentina. So during the third quarter. So 
Q4was doomed in a way, because of when we sell in Q4 and when 
thishappened. And that's also affecting the-- some of the Q1 revenue 
andat least the Q1 projections we have right now. If we can 
rememberthat, Brazil real hit BRL 4.20. It's now at BRL 3.70 and 
theArgentina peso hit ARS 42, and it's now at ARS 36. So kind of 
theworst of that currency devaluations when we were selling Q4 and 
someof January and February of the first quarter. So group 
revenueprojections are affected by that, but that's a reality, right? 
That'sreal. That's what happened. Lately, as I mentioned before, 
we'reseeing demand in terms of traffic strengthening in both 
markets.We've had also cut back some capacity. So that obviously 
helps,carding capacity helps, but load factors year-over-year are 
eitherflat or above 2017 in both Brazil and Argentina in terms of 
whatwe're seeing right now. But yields are still very weak. So in 
bothmarkets for the reasons I just mentioned, we're projecting a 
weakeryields in the first quarter. And -- but we are optimistic that 
we'regoing to see a recovery in the rest of the year. How soon and 
howstrong, hard to tell right now.</p>
<p><b>JOSE MONTERO:</b> I was going to say exactly. I think that, what 
we'reseeing is Brazil is stabilizing a little bit ahead of Argentina 
atthis stage. So I think a point of reference for how we're seeingthings
 at the moment.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes 
ourquestion-and-answer session for today. So now it is my pleasure 
tohand the conference back over to Mr. Pedro Heilbron for any 
closingcomments or remarks.</p>
<p><b>PEDRO HEILBRON:</b> Okay. Thank you. So this concludes our 
earnings call.Thank you for being with us. Thank you for your continued 
support.And I want to emphasize that, that we have all the pieces in 
theright place. And this maybe I'm repeating myself, but we have thebest
 unit cost of almost any full-service airline. Our heart is stillin the 
best geographic position and still growing and strengthening.And 
operationally, we have a product that customers want to fly. Sowe faced 
very strong headwinds, may be again maybe as the story ofthe last few 
years in these 2 markets, but we know those markets arecoming back and 
we're going to be in the best position to continuereturning very strong 
margins. So again, thank you, and have a greatday.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your 
participation.That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, 
and have awonderful day.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and thank you for holding. And welcome
 to Acorn Energy's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. (Operator 
Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.</p>
<p> I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Jones, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
<p> WILLIAM JONES: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Acorn Energy's 
third quarter conference call. First, as a reminder, many of the 
statements made in today's prepared remarks or in response to your 
questions may be forward-looking. These statements are subject to 
various risks and uncertainties. For example, the performance of 
OmniMetrix and Acorn in 2018 and future years is subject to factors such
 as risks associated with executing its operating strategy, maintaining 
high renewal rates, growing its customer base, changes in technology, 
changes in the competitive environment, financial and economic risks as 
well as having access to sufficient capital to support growth. Such 
forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs as well as 
assumptions made which are based upon information currently available to
 management pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private 
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There is no assurance that 
Acorn or OmniMetrix will be able to achieve their growth goals in 2018 
or future years. And the company undertakes no obligation to disclose 
any revision to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or 
circumstances after the date made.</p>
<p> A complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect
 the company is included in Risk Factors on Acorn's 10-K as filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p> And with that, I'll hand the call over to Jan Loeb. Jan?</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ACORN ENERGY, INC.: 
Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us today. I have some 
overall remarks. Tracy Clifford, our CFO, will provide financial 
highlights; and Walter Czarnecki, the CEO of OmniMetrix, will provide 
additional color on the business and its growth trends.</p>
<p> To start, I would like to congratulate the OmniMetrix team for 
achieving operating profit in the third quarter, its first ever 
quarterly operating profit. Walter and his team have been striving to 
grow the business while also seeking to enhance its profitability, goals
 that are not typically easy to achieve at the same time.</p>
<p> As most of you already know, OmniMetrix monitors, manages and 
protects high-value industrial assets for customers through its 
proprietary remote monitoring and control technology and related 
services. OmniMetrix remote monitoring solutions deliver substantial 
productivity increases and cost reductions to customers versus the 
alternative, which is regular physical on-site inspections often across a
 variety of remote locations. The business consists of hardware 
monitoring equipment sales for new installations, ongoing monitoring 
service fees as well as custom and porting fees. The monitoring side of 
the business offers a very attractive combination of visibility from 
recurring service revenue along with a very strong gross profit margin. 
All of Acorn's revenue currently comes from the OmniMetrix business, 
which remains on a solid growth trajectory with a promising outlook.</p>
<p> Since my involvement with the company, I believe that this was the 
Acorn subsidiary with the greatest growth potential, which is why we 
sold or liquidated other businesses in order to focus on scaling 
OmniMetrix from a strong foundation to realize its full potential. 
Although it wasn't profitable 2 years ago, we could envision that its 
growth and healthy gross margin would ultimately lead to profitability, 
which we were able to achieve in the third quarter.</p>
<p> Looking forward, there is increasing awareness by industrial 
customers of productivity increases, lower operating costs and risk 
management benefits that can be realized through IoT technology, such as
 remote monitoring. Walter can speak more to our strategy to build our 
leadership and capabilities in this space and how our services are very 
relevant in the real world today.</p>
<p> Earlier this year, we sold our remaining interest in Israeli-based 
DSIT to focus on IoT. During the third quarter, we recouped 
approximately $300,000 from Israel related to withholding taxes on the 
initial sale of a portion of our DSIT investment in April 2016. We 
received the cash and recorded a gain of $222,000 related to this 
payment during the third quarter. The cash is being held in our account 
in Israel until final review by the Israeli taxing authorities of tax 
returns through 2018, which we expect by year-end 2019.</p>
<p> On prior calls, we have discussed potential acquisitions in remote 
monitoring of industrial assets. In recent months, we have looked at 
several candidates and narrowed our focus. Our goal is to complete a 
complementary acquisition that would allow the team to scale the 
business and position us to accelerate and sustain profitability and 
thereby benefit from over $60 million in operating loss carryforwards.</p>
<p> We seek businesses with both growth potential as well as recurring 
revenue models that would be similar and synergistic to OmniMetrix.</p>
<p> We also plan to change our name from Acorn to something that is more
 representative of our forward focus. However, that decision will be 
influenced by our efforts on the M&amp;A front.</p>
<p> Let me now turn to our forward-looking metrics and goals for the business.</p>
<p> For the full year 2018, we have guided to $6 million or 
approximately 20% growth in cash basis sales, which represents revenue 
plus the increase in deferred revenue. Cash basis sales were $1.5 
million in Q3 2018, an increase of 25% over Q3 2017. Through September 
30, 2018, cash basis sales have increased 80% to $4.1 million compared 
to for the first 9 months of 2017. We believe we're on pace to achieve 
our initial goal, and therefore, maintain our $6 million cash basis 
sales guidance for the full year.</p>
<p> In accordance with GAAP revenue recognition, we amortized our 
contract revenue over the estimated life of the contract and over the 
expected life of the hardware. As a result, while in growth mode, 
recorded revenue is generally lower than cash basis sales and can mask 
underlying growth, particularly given that we typically receive cash 
payments upfront. For that reason, we believe that investors should 
consider cash sales as well as revenue trends in their analysis of our 
business.</p>
<p> Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Tracy Clifford, to go over financial highlights. Tracy?</p>
<p> TRACY S. CLIFFORD, CFO, ACORN ENERGY, INC.: Thank you, Jan. Acorn's 
third quarter revenue, which is solely comprised of revenue from our 80%
 owned OmniMetrix subsidiary rose to $1.3 million, a 23% increase 
compared to the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> The revenue increase was driven by growth in our pipeline monitoring
 segment, which grew 49% to $406,000 over third quarter '17, while 
revenues from our standby generator monitoring segment grew 14.5% over 
third quarter '17 to $931,000.</p>
<p> From a service versus hardware perspective, higher-margin monitoring
 revenues grew 26% in the third quarter of 2018 while hardware revenues 
grew 20% versus the same period in the prior year. Gross profit grew 32%
 to $831,000 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter 
2017, reflecting an increase in gross margin to 62% in the third quarter
 of 2018 compared to 58% in the prior year period. This overall margin 
increase was principally due to the result of sales of next-generation 
monitoring products, which with improved functionality also provide 
higher gross margin. Despite the revenue increase, OmniMetrix operating 
cost remained fairly stable at $810,000 in the third quarter of 2018 and
 $811,000 in the third quarter of '17. With revenue and gross profit 
growing faster than operating expenses, OmniMetrix reported first ever 
quarterly operating income of $21,000 in the third quarter of 2018 
versus an operating loss of $182,000 in the third quarter of '17. This 
represents $203,000 of profit improvement on $252,000 of additional 
revenue, or $0.01 contribution per additional revenue dollar -- I'm 
sorry, or an $0.81 contribution per additional revenue dollar, which 
underscores the attractiveness of incremental growth on business 
performance.</p>
<p> Acorn's corporate SG&amp;A decreased $98,000 in the third quarter of
 2018 to $251,000 or approximately 28% as compared to the prior year 
period. As a result of improved performance in OmniMetrix and lower 
corporate overhead, Acorn's consolidated operating loss decreased 57% to
 $230,000 in third quarter of 2018 from $584,000 in the third quarter of
 '17.</p>
<p> Including a gain of $222,000 from the recoupment withholdings from 
the Israeli tax authority related to our prior sale of DSIT, Acorn 
reported a third quarter 2018 net income attributable to shareholders of
 $4,000 with no contribution per share. This compares to the third 
quarter of 2017 net income attributable to shareholders of $236,000 or 
1% per share. The prior year quarter benefited from Acorn's share of 
DSIT income in the period of $189,000 as well as $633,000 of net income 
from disc ops.</p>
<p> Turning to cash flow. For the first 9 months of 2018, net cash and 
cash equivalents increased by $941,000. The company used $2.3 million in
 operating activities, including the repayment of $1.4 million of 
accumulated unpaid operating expenses previously funded by advances from
 DSIT. Acorn generated $5 million from investing activities on the sale 
of DSIT and used $1.8 million in financing activities related to the 
repayment of $1.3 million in director loans and $340,000 of funds from 
DSIT and some on short-term credit.</p>
<p> As of September 30, 2018, Acorn had cash and cash equivalents, 
including restricted cash, of $1.7 million. OmniMetrix had approximately
 $199,000 outstanding on its accounts receivable factoring arrangement.</p>
<p> Given the strength of OmniMetrix business, management let the 
company's accounts receivable factoring arrangement expire and paid off 
the balance in its entirety in early November. We're currently seeking 
to secure a new credit line with more favorable terms to execute in the 
near term.</p>
<p> Importantly, based on its recent performance, we expect OmniMetrix to be both profitable and cash flow positive in 2019.</p>
<p> Now I'd like to turn the call over to Walter Czarnecki to provide 
some additional color related to our OmniMetrix business. Walter?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI, PRESIDENT AND COO OF OMNIMETRIX, LLC, ACORN 
ENERGY, INC.: Thank you, Tracy. At OmniMetrix, we remain very excited 
about both the progress we've made and the market potential in front of 
us. As Jan and I have discussed in previous quarters, the IoT market 
remains large, and for the most part, untapped.</p>
<p> In September of this year, we learned of a new macro market trend 
for the power generation industry. At the most recent Electrical 
Generating Systems Association Conference, it was widely discussed that 
the installed base of backup generators is now at a level that will 
outpace the capacity of service technicians at generator service 
organizations.</p>
<p> These service organizations, as many of you know, are one of our key
 sales channels for the Power Generation division. Thus, generator 
service organizations will need to adopt remote monitoring in order to 
maintain their current customer base and to expand. We will track this 
trend as it develops and share more with you in future quarters.</p>
<p> We're also excited to tell you about AIRGuard, our newest product, 
which remotely monitors and controls air compressors. As many of you 
know, our product line in the Power Generation division is not limited 
to generators. It is for any industrial engine application. While we 
have focused on backup generators, given that market's size and growth, 
our long-term strategy has always been to expand horizontally to other 
industrial applications.</p>
<p> As such, last month, we shipped our first AIRGuards, all of which 
will monitor Ingersoll Rand compressors. The initial feedback has been 
positive, and we will continue to update you in future quarters as this 
market develops.</p>
<p> Finally, growth and progress also continues in our Cathodic 
Protection division. We installed our first products in Mexico during 
the quarter. And similar to the Power Generation market, there is a 
large potential with utilities and pipeline companies that are turning 
more to remote monitoring to better manage their pipeline networks.</p>
<p> Thank you, again, for joining us today. And I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) First question will come from Richard Sosa, a private investor.</p>
<p> RICHARD SOSA: [Leave it to] Acorn in this massive Micro cast that 
you guys have your best quarter since I've owned the stock in 2016. So 
congratulations to everyone. I had a question -- a few questions. One on
 the corporate expense. Do you -- being -- if you don't make an 
acquisition this year, do you see it in the fourth quarter and going 
forward at $250,000? Is that kind of a fair number? I see that that's 
slower than the prior quarters.</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: I would say -- Richard, thank you very much for your 
comments, firstly. I would say, it is our goal to have it lower than 
that. This year, in 2018, we still had DSIT for the first 4 months of 
the year. So we're now a cleaner company. So hopefully we'd save some 
money on auditing expenses in the future. We have a -- our Board of 
Directors is a little bit changed versus last year. So we should have 
some savings there. So I believe it will be lower in 2019 than it was in
 2018 ex any potential acquisitions.</p>
<p> RICHARD SOSA: And then just 2 more questions. On -- just in the cash
 sales, you mentioned third quarter was $1.5 million. So that would lead
 me to believe that for the fourth quarter you're in the 1.85 range. 
Would that mean that the fourth quarter Acorn, as a whole, would be cash
 flow positive? Or are you kind of getting close? Or am I off?</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: That is our goal.</p>
<p> RICHARD SOSA: Okay. And I guess the last question is for Walter. I 
noticed in 2017, you had a Power Generation segment, kind of static, and
 so far this year, I feel that the trend's reversed and we see now 3 -- 4
 consecutive quarters of growth in the Power Generation market with some
 very nice growth this quarter. And you had mentioned some of these 
trends, these macro market trends. Do you think it has something to do 
with that? Or are there other things at play?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: I think there are a few factors at play. Firstly, 
the growth in new generator sales from the OEMs and from the generator 
service organizations are leading market indicator for us. And so we've 
always tracked pretty closely in terms of the growth of new generator 
sales. And what we heard across the industry in 2017 was that, while 
growth was continuing, it was a bit down from prior years. In 2014, '15,
 and '16, there was really quite a growth at the larger manufacturers, 
Generac, Kohler and Caterpillar, all saw. That tracked back a bit in 
2017. And in 2018, year-to-date, we're seeing that -- those growth 
levels return to what we saw a few years ago. So that's been certainly 
one of the driving factors. And just further awareness across the market
 of backup generators. We're seeing incredible growth in the residential
 market. And that's becoming much more of a key part of smart home 
ecosystem that many more consumers are taking on.</p>
<p> RICHARD SOSA: And then just Walter, this air compressor market, would that be going forward in the Power Generation segment?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: It's across a number of segments. But primarily, 
we will be partnering, as we have, in the Power Generation division, 
with the service organizations that are selling and providing 
preventative maintenance for the air compressors.</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: Yes. But it will be reported in our Power Generation line of business.</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p> RICHARD SOSA: Okay, great. That's again -- the quarter surprised me. So it's nice to be pleasantly surprised to the upside.</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: Hopefully, we'll do that in the future as well.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question will be from [Jack Maier], a private investor.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The previous caller asked about the -- 
what the projected revenue would be or cash revenue for the fourth 
quarter to get your goal. And that sounds like a pretty dramatic 
quarter-on-quarter increase. Is there some seasonal factor to that? Or 
is that something you think you can, sort of, maintain for a number of 
quarters going forward?</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: I'll let Walter handle that. Walter?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: Sure. Jack, thanks for the question. Yes, there 
are a few factors in play there in terms of seasonality and timing. 
Number one, historically, we have seen half 2 higher in sales than half 
1. And that is, in part, due to the fact that generator dealers and 
installers are going out in the spring and summer. And so we don't see 
that -- those sales really pick up until later in the year. That's also 
the same to some extent for the Cathodic Protection division. And so 
historically, Q4 has been a particularly strong quarter for us. We've 
seen that the past several years. And we expect that again this year.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Great. And Tracy, I believe, 
mentioned before that in effect, you were getting something like 81% to 
the bottom line of the increased revenue. Do you see anything in the 
fourth quarter that would make your SG&amp;A go up significantly? Or 
could we expect something like that on the increased sales for Q4?</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: I would say that, the 81% is quite a large percentage 
drop to -- on incremental sales to drop to the bottom line. I mean we do
 have a fairly high gross profit margin in our business, which has been 
improving over the last few years. So we do expect a big percentage to 
drop to the bottom line of our incremental sales. But we are in a growth
 business and at all times, we have to weigh investment in our business 
versus profitability. So do we want to hire another salesperson, we want
 to make investments in systems. So these are decisions we're making all
 the time. So I don't want to promise an 81% drop of incremental sales 
to the bottom line. But it should be a fairly large drop. And anything 
that -- if it doesn't show up, it's because we're investing in the 
business. And hopefully, that would show up in strong growth in later 
periods.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And getting back, if I may, to the 
seasonality. What -- if you sort of normalize this in some sense and 
take out the seasonality, what type of growth are we seeing 
year-over-year? I mean, do you see that accelerating right now in terms 
of the business -- the way the business is running? Do you see that 
being more or less -- do you see that more or less as being sort of 
staying on the same growth path, absent acquisitions for the next 12 to 
15 months?</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: I think we are comfortable with what we've said in the 
past of the 20% annual growth in sales. We are obviously striving to 
better that. But I think we're comfortable with the 20% out into the 
future.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p>
<p> WILLIAM JONES: There is a question coming from online, if I may read that.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Please proceed.</p>
<p> WILLIAM JONES: So the question is, basically, please discuss and 
explain the deferred charges and deferred revenue numbers on the balance
 sheet. These are significant relative to the total balance sheet. 
That's the question, I guess, for Tracy.</p>
<p> TRACY S. CLIFFORD: Okay. Sure. So the deferred charges or the 
deferred cost of goods sold in accordance with GAAP, the hardware sales 
that we make, even though the revenue is received at the time of the 
sale, is amortized over the average life of that hardware piece, which 
was determined to be 3 years. Previously, it was 2 years and there was 
an updated analysis done last year, at the end of the year. So in 2018, 
we have been amortizing the hardware COGS over a 3-year period. Also 
along with that would be the revenue that we recognized on the hardware.
 So that's also amortized over 3 years. And then additionally, any 
monitoring revenue is amortized over the period from which it benefits. 
So if it is a 12-year monitoring that has been sold, then that revenue 
will be -- I'm sorry, 12-month, that revenue will be amortized over 12 
months. So that's what results in the deferred revenue, both current and
 long term, and the deferred charges.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: We do have another question from the phone. And that question will be from Bill Summitt with Golconda Capital.</p>
<p> BILL SUMMITT: So the compressor -- AIRGuard compressor market, how 
does that compare to the size of the power generation market? And I'm 
not asking for specific numbers because there's no way to know. But just
 compared to the power, how big is that market?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: We see it relative the same. We're going through 
similar analysis right now in terms of total addressable market in terms
 of not only equipment that is out there but equipment that would likely
 be candidates for monitoring. And so far, we're finding it similar to 
that of the power generation market, which is in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars in the U.S.</p>
<p> BILL SUMMITT: Okay. And competitors for compressors, is that kind of
 the same as for Power Generation, the actual manufacturer of the 
compressors, other third-party monitoring?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: So we will be learning that as we go across -- 
we've looked at the major compressor brands. Because as with Power 
Generation, we absolutely plan to map to every major compressor brand to
 be flexible to our customers. Some of the major brands do have their 
own monitoring products, which we've seen in the power generation 
market. We've continued to be successful in that power generation market
 despite that competition. And so we feel confident given the product 
and our customer experience that we deliver to both the service 
organizations and the end users that we can win in this market.</p>
<p> BILL SUMMITT: Okay. Do the dealers will -- are the dealers the one 
that will generally install the kind of the third-party monitors, like 
ours?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: That is typically the case. Sometimes you will see
 end users that have their own team of folks that work with 
installations. But for the most part, it's the service organizations 
that are doing the installations.</p>
<p> BILL SUMMITT: Okay. And is there an advantage to the end customer to
 having a monitoring system that is not tied to a specific brand?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: The main advantage there is that -- well, I can 
tell you what we've seen in the power generation market, which is it's 
very unusual to find, if you look at a large campus whether it be a 
hospital system or university or a large national chain, it's very rare 
for them to have only one brand of generator. Because they'll install a 
few, they'll do it incrementally, and each year, they'll put a bid out 
for multiple brands and they'll take the one that fits the best. And so 
what's more common is, we'll see a hospital system with a few Generacs, a
 few Kohlers, a few Cummins, and they'll need a solution that works 
across that campus. And that's another way that we compete and win in 
terms of having that flexibility and enabling both the end user and the 
service organization to have 1 platform from which they can monitor 
various brands. And so as we learn more about the compressor market and 
if we find that, that is the case, then we feel comfortable operating in
 that type of market dynamic.</p>
<p> BILL SUMMITT: Okay. And my last question on this dynamic is, do the 
dealers have an incentive to want to kind of carry one monitoring brand.
 So if someone comes in and buys a -- either a compressor or a power 
generator, does the dealer have an incentive to say, okay, we're always 
going to install this one monitor?</p>
<p> WALTER CZARNECKI: So certainly for simplicity, it does. And some of 
our customers will only sell OmniMetrix equipment. Others will sell 
multiple brands, in part because there's a sensitive line that they need
 to walk with respect to the manufacturer of brand that they're 
representing. And so there is some sensitivity there. But certainly for 
simplicity, it's easier to have just 1 monitoring system.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Ladies and gentlemen, this 
concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the 
conference back over to Jan Loeb for any closing remarks.</p>
<p> JAN H. LOEB: We are now an IoT-focused company with an improved 
balance sheet and lower cost structure. And we are well positioned for 
our next phase. From here, top line growth and operating leverage would 
continue to drive bottom line performance, which is the driver of 
shareholder value. We would also like to supplement growth at OmniMetrix
 with suitable and similar acquisitions.</p>
<p> I want to thank you all for your interest in Acorn. More than ever, I
 believe that Acorn represents an attractive platform for building value
 for shareholders. I'm grateful for the support of our investors, and 
I'm pleased to speak with anyone who has specific questions about the 
company or our plans. Just contact our Investor Relations team to set up
 a call with me and ask any questions you may have. Thank you again for 
your time today. And with that operator, we can end the call. Thank you.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you

<p> I would like to remind everyone that forward-looking statements for

in product and technology development and the effect of the company's 
accounting policies, as well as certain other risk factors, which are 
detailed from time-to-time in the company's filings with the various 
securities authorities.</p>
<p> Mr. Koren, would you like to begin?</p>
<p> OFER KOREN, CFO, HEAD OF FINANCE, SENIOR DEPUTY MD &amp; MEMBER OF 
THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT, BANK HAPOALIM B.M.: Thank you, operator. 
Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining today's call. It is my pleasure 
to take you through Bank Hapoalim's financial results for the third 
quarter of 2018. My comments today will accompany the slide 
presentation, which is available for you on our website.</p>
<p> Slide 3 of the presentation provides the summary overview of the key
 performance metrics for the quarter. Another excellent quarter for the 
bank across the board, with strong and sustainable financial 
performance. We continue to build up our loan book and strengthen our 
retail deposit base, all while expanding margins, efforts that have 
contributed to a significant uplift in income across all segments of the
 bank's activity in Israel. In parallel to this growth, the bank's 
fundamentals continued to track well.</p>
<p> In terms of asset quality, cost of risks continue to remain low, and
 NPL rate is tracking at very low levels. Diligent emphasis on 
efficiency remains a part of our DNA at the bank, with further reduction
 in the cost-income ratio this quarter to 57.6%. The bank's capital base
 continues to strengthen and stands today well above both internal and 
regulatory targets. And I will touch on the issue of capital 
distribution further in my presentation.</p>
<p> All of this have contributed to a strong 10.7% ROE for the quarter, 
an excellent achievement considering the external factors weighing on 
the bank such as the U.S. investigation. With this in mind, let us move 
to Slide 4 to look at the P&amp;L in more detail.</p>
<p> Reported net profit for the third quarter stood at NIS 950 million, 
the highest in the Israeli banking sector. Net profit and ROE for the 
quarter have outperformed both corresponding and previous quarter 
results, a testament to the consistent improvement in the bank's 
financial metrics and performance.</p>
<p> As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2018, the bank adopted 
accounting principles, which require our subsidiary activity Isracard to
 be classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, unless otherwise
 stated, analysis presented in this presentation regarding balance sheet
 and P&amp;L items refer solely to the continued operation of the bank.</p>
<p> Looking at Slide 5. The bank continues to lead the local banking 
sector with Israel's largest credit portfolio, ending the quarter with 
NIS 2,000 -- NIS 276 billion, a 3.7% growth compared with year-end 
balances, well above the estimated GDP growth rate of the Israeli 
economy.</p>
<p> The bank's portfolio mix continues to be increasingly diversified 
over a range of segments, reflecting the efforts the bank has made in 
recent years to improve the overall mix of credit book and to benefit 
from a range of income sources and risk diversification.</p>
<p> Slide 6 provide the closer look at credit growth across different 
customer segments. Of note is the strong growth in the commercial and 
corporate segments, having grown 7.7% and 6.2%, respectively, since 
year-end. The commercial segment has grown 5% in the third quarter 
alone, benefiting from a renewed service model.</p>
<p> Housing loans grew by 6.6% since the year-end and 2% in the third 
quarter alone, reflecting the bank's strategic aim to increase its 
market share in this segment on the back of healthier margins.</p>
<p> In the consumer lending and small businesses, the bank optimized its
 pricing models and risk profile, in line with the changing level of 
risks we identified in the market, all of that affecting growth.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 7. Retail deposits continue to maintain the lion 
share of the bank total deposits and the base of its funding structure, 
growing by an impressive 3.7% since year-end and increasing their share 
of the overall pie to 64%. This is a significant advantage with the 
increased likelihood of an interest rate increase in Israel in the 
beginning of 2019.</p>
<p> The upsurge in business activity is reflected in the financing 
income on the next slide. The graph demonstrates the positive trends 
we've been experiencing in financial margin over the past few years, 
although the near 0 interest environment in Israel.</p>
<p> The healthy margins for the third quarter of 229 basis points were 
mainly influenced by the ongoing diversification of the bank's credit 
portfolio, increase in the margin of business owned activities and the 
effect of the increase in Federal Reserve interest rates. As a reminder,
 margins in the previous quarter were influenced by relatively high CPI,
 which contributed an income of NIS 138 million to that quarter's 
results.</p>
<p> Looking at the graph at the bottom of the slide, the bank recorded 
another strong quarter of profit from financing activity, increasing by 
6.7% year-on-year on the back of the volume growth and improved 
financial margins I noted earlier.</p>
<p> Both volumes and margins have had a strong impact on income growth 
across all segments of activity as demonstrated on Slide 9. Notable of 
which is an impressive growth year-on-year of over 25% in housing loans.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 10. We note the bank's ongoing track record in 
recent years of reducing problematic debt and those stabilize at current
 levels. Note that when looking at the different debt components, 
impaired debt in the third quarter has declined. This trend in 
problematic debt is also apparent on the next slide as we take a closer 
look at NPL ratios. The percentage of this problematic debt has declined
 significantly over the years reaching 0.79% in the third quarter.</p>
<p> The high quality of the loan book is also reflected in our credit 
losses shown on Slide 12, which has also been tracking at low levels in 
recent years. This quarter, we recorded net provision for credit losses 
in the amount of NIS 118 million, reflecting an annual rate of 0.17% of 
total loans.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 13, looking at our fees on the day after the 
separation from Isracard. Fees and other income in the third quarter 
were affected by seasonal and timing influences and reflected in lower 
than average securities activities, credit handling fees and other 
income.</p>
<p> Moving to operating expenses on Slide 14. Cost income continued its 
downward trend and stood at 57.6% in the third quarter, this -- as the 
bank continues to remain committed to reducing its cost base and 
successfully implementing its current efficiency program. The effect of 
which can already be seen in the impressive decline in wage cost this 
quarter.</p>
<p> The slight increase in other expenses in the third quarter is 
attributable to NIS 142 million of legal expenses associated with the 
U.S. investigation, this compared with NIS 103 million of legal cost in 
the previous quarter, reflecting the extensive efforts the bank 
continues to make in this regard.</p>
<p> Moving to our strong capital base on Slide 15. The bank continues to
 maintain a very strong capital position with its common equity Tier 1 
capital ratio at 11.32% at the end of the reporting period, well above 
target. Although this healthy capital buffers, as you'll note from the 
next slide, the bank continues to track with conservatism and did not 
declare distribution of dividend in respect of third quarter's losses.</p>
<p> Wrapping up on Slide 17. The third quarter of 2018 has been a very 
strong quarter for the bank, demonstrating that the underlying 
fundamentals of the business are solid and tracking well. The bank has 
repeatedly shown its ability to implement its strategic direction in 
line with the risks and opportunities it identifies in the market or 
while managing its ongoing cost base diligently, delivering a net profit
 of NIS 950 million and an impressive ROE of 10.7% for the quarter.</p>
<p> With that said, let me open the call for any questions you may have. Operator?</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome 
to Strauss Group Third Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. (Operator 
Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, 
Wednesday, November 14, 2018.</p>
<p> I would like to remind everyone that the conference call may contain
 projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events
 or the future performance of the company. These statements are only 
projections and may change as time passes.</p>
<p> Strauss does not assume any obligation to update that information.</p>
<p> Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected,
 including as a result of changing industry and market trends, reduced 
demand for our products, the timely development of our new products and 
the adoption by the market, increased competition in the industry and 
price reductions as well as due to risks identified in the documents 
filed by the company with the ISA.</p>
<p> With us on the line today are Mr. Giora Bardea, CEO of Strauss 
Group; Mr. Shahar Florence, CFO; and Ms. Daniella Finn, Director of 
Investor Relations. Mr. Bardea, please go ahead.</p>
<p> GIORA BARDEA, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, STRAUSS GROUP LTD.: Okay, good 
afternoon. Good morning, everybody. I'm here -- we are here in Israel. 
My name is Giora Bardea.</p>
<p> Just a couple of words about myself, about the history. I'm the new 
CEO for Strauss Group. I've been with Strauss for the last 20 years -- 
22 years, sorry, and I've gone through all the main businesses or the 
companies of Strauss. I've been in the capital here in Israel as the 
head -- CEO of Elite before the merger with Strauss and then managed the
 Israeli activities after the merger. 2006, '07, I moved -- relocated to
 the U.S. to expand the Strauss business out of Israel, mainly in U.S., 
and build and to support the expansion and partnership with Pepsi. What 
we have today is Sabra, Obela, at that time, Max Brenner. 2014, I moved 
back to Israel and become the Deputy CEO of Strauss being responsible 
for strategy -- business global strategy and technology, business 
innovation, digital communication, et cetera, et cetera. During this 
period of time, I have been the Chairman of the Water business and the 
dips and spreads with Pepsi business.</p>
<p> So I'm here after 22 years and I'm very familiar with Strauss 
activities, very committed and believe and one of those that believe 
that team Strauss we have really amazing, stable business with the right
 technology category, global partners and local partners, shareholders, 
team. And I really believe Strauss can deliver like we did this quarter 
and the quarter before, we can deliver pretty strong results because we 
have the real what we call here the raw -- the building blocks of the 
raw materials in order to build long-term growth and successful 
business.</p>
<p> So thank you for being with us and I believe in the future, we'll 
meet you -- some of you face-to-face. I hand over to Shahar, the CFO of 
the group, to share the quarter results.</p>
<p> SHAHAR FLORENCE, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, STRAUSS GROUP LTD.: Giora, 
thank you very much. Congratulations for the nomination. And I think 
this is a good demonstration of management continuity within the group 
and the ability to raise and keep good management within the company for
 a long time for the benefits of the business. So thank you.</p>
<p> Looking at the third quarter results and the first 9 months, I'm 
looking at Slide #4. This is a good demonstration for the continuous 
growth that we experienced both in sales, EBIT, net and also cash flows 
and controlling the debt.</p>
<p> If we're looking on the companies for the last 4 years, you can see 
the consecutive growth of sales, we will talk later on in Q3, which was 
in debt terms a little bit lower. But as a whole, you can see that the 
company is growing, growing in almost all the segments that we are 
active in. And we can translate this growth into profits and cash flows.</p>
<p> So the EBIT actually changed platform from ILS 500 million that 
we've been in 2016 to almost ILS 700 million, very close to the EBITDA 
at the beginning of this period. If we are looking only on the last 3 
years, we almost doubled the net income in the 4 years, moving from ILS 
219 million to ILS 400 million net profit. It's almost doubling the 
company in 4 years as a result of executing our strategy.</p>
<p> You can see that the growth -- later on you can see that the growth 
came from almost all the companies within the group. So this is for the 9
 months. I'm looking at it as a whole from the group's perspective. 
Later on, at the appendixes, you can have the breakdown per company per 
business.</p>
<p> So we'll move to the third quarter results and later on maybe we'll 
accomplish with the 9 months. So in the third quarter, you can see that 
Strauss Israel capital momentum grew much more than the market, 3.6% 
growth versus the market that grew less than 2%. The growth came from 
almost every Strauss category that we have. If you look at the local 
Nielsen or StoreNext and the different sub-categories, you could see 
that we took market share in almost all of them. We translated -- or 
transformed this growth into expanding the profit.</p>
<p> Here, in the Health &amp; Wellness, a little bit less in 
percentage-wise than the growth in sales mainly due to the meat prices. 
As you all know, we gave a notice to the public that we will not raise 
prices knowing that the meat prices will go down even without the maybe 
new legislation that might happen in Israel, and actually they are going
 down in Q4 so we will be able to expand the margins a little bit going 
forward. But still, a growth in sales.</p>
<p> And in the confectionery business, we leveraged the 2.4% growth into
 more than 4% growth in the EBIT, that means expanding the margins.</p>
<p> So this is about Strauss Israel. A lot of innovation investing in 
the nutritional values of our product. Lowering sugar, salt, fat and so 
on. We invest a lot of money in it, as you know, to find replacements 
for the sugar cost money, but we believe that at the end of the day, it 
will be translated in better sales and higher market share.</p>
<p> Also investing in our employees. We pay more than the minimum 
salary. We don't have any -- even one employee that is getting the 
minimal salary by the law. And again, transforming our employees to our 
partners, it's a strategy that we believe pays itself even in the most 
cynical aspect of financial results. So this is Strauss Israel.</p>
<p> As far as Strauss Coffee. Here, the picture in the last quarter is a little bit mixed.</p>
<p> Looking on the segments of Coffee Israel, you can see an improvement
 in all aspects. Very similar, by the way, during the year to the 
confectionery business of Strauss Israel, very correlated growth both in
 sales and in the margins.</p>
<p> As far as the international activities. Here, again, I will divide 
it between Brazil and Eastern Europe. In Brazil, if we're looking at the
 market, we are taking -- keep taking market share, going up from 23% 
market share last year to 27% market share while our competitors are 
getting weaker and weaker. It enabled us to improve the gross margins as
 a result of being strong #1 in the coffee market. Unlike, and this is 
maybe the only unlike that I will say between the third quarter and the 9
 months, is the profits in Brazil. The EBIT went down a little bit in 
local currency from BRL 107 million to BRL 100 million mainly because of
 the investment in the single portion in our reports in shekels. You can
 see that the loss of Três, the single portion operation, is a little 
bit higher, more, by the way, than the whole reduction in EBIT. That 
means that the whole reduction comes from higher investment there. We 
are growing very, very fast in single portion. And therefore, we decided
 to keep the investment in this segment. We already have 1.2 million 
machines sold and the usage per machine is going up. We are, I would say
 very carefully, at least par with Dolce Gusto of Nestlé, if not even 
slightly bigger than that. And our aspiration there is to take the same 
leadership as we have in the whole coffee market in Brazil, also in the 
single portion.</p>
<p> Looking at the shekel results of scores the fact that the real 
during the year -- sorry, during the quarter has moved from about BRL 
3.7 to $1 to BRL 4.2 to $1 helped us as far as the translation. Usually,
 when we analyze such things like the currencies and commodities, I 
can't anticipate the cycle and I always tell you when commodities and 
currencies go up and down and we are looking on the longer term. Here, 
exceptionally I can say the cycle has already turned upside down and we 
all know that the reais now is back on BRL 3.7, BRL 3.8, so much lower 
than the averages of Q3. So looking forward on Q4, each if you can do 
the math and make the anticipation going forward. So I'm not too 
influenced by the fact the translation in Q3 was worse than last year. 
So this is about Brazil.</p>
<p> Again, from my point of view, a very good performance, 4.6% growth 
in value in local currencies, 10% in value. And this is also due to the 
fact that the green coffee prices went down. So prices eroded a little 
bit, but the profit per pound -- or per kilo is higher and at the end of
 the day we can sell our product in lower prices to the consumers and 
allow them to buy more, but still make more profit per kilo is a good 
phenomenon.</p>
<p> The one thing that was challenging this quarter was mainly Russia 
and Ukraine. There, we suffered from price reductions in the market. 
Very tough competition with the JD and Nestlé, and therefore, we were 
hit both in sales and in profit. And this is the most challenging, if 
not the only one in this quarter out of the whole portfolio.</p>
<p> The rest of the countries, Poland, had very, very good -- 
exceptional year last year. This year is a little bit lower, but still 
in the long-term perspective, it's a good performance. Romania went down
 -- went up a little bit, 2.3% growth in sales. But again, versus, I 
would say, less good last year. But all in all, is the main impact was 
Russia and the Ukraine out of the whole Eastern European cluster in 
coffee. So this is the coffee.</p>
<p> As far as the dips and spreads activities, Sabra has reached back to
 the 50% market share in previous years. Margins are going up, we are 
about 10% -- sorry, EBIT margin in this year as we, I think, anticipated
 in the last quarter. And as I said before, we accept -- expect 
ourselves to improve it even next year to low double-digit profit. This 
is the only point in this conversation that I would say looking-forward 
statement. But we have said it before. We're looking for a way to 
increase the sales by finding new consumption moments for our product, 
putting more emphasis on the on-the-go and away-from-home other than the
 regular dips occasions at home that the product will be well selling 
through the retailers pitch those locations.</p>
<p> If I'm looking on the Obela activities, you can see a nice growth, 
mainly coming from Australia and New Zealand, but also in smaller 
numbers, from Mexico and Western Europe.</p>
<p> Last, but not least, Strauss Water. Remember that the numbers that 
you see even in the managerial report, the non-GAAP reports do not 
include the Haier Strauss Water numbers. So without -- Haier Strauss, 
yes, the Chinese activities -- without the Chinese activities, we grew 
more than 8% due to the Israeli and the U.K. activities, which is a 
very, very strong phenomenon. You won't find any other market in food 
and beverages, neither in food nor beverages that grows in such manner 
and the source of growth comes from both all sorts of water, both the 5 
gallons and so on and also from strong soft drink market.</p>
<p> And if are looking on China with 10% growth, again, most of the 
markets that we work, again, we expect ourselves or expecting from 
ourselves to be able to grow in higher numbers than that. But still, we 
grew 10% in China in sales.</p>
<p> If I'm looking on the profits that include our share in the Chinese 
profit, you could see that Strauss Water has doubled the profits this 
quarter. And in the 9 months, we moved from ILS 9 million to ILS 18 
million EBIT profit. And this shows you the good improvements in our 
Water activities. So this is about the separated results of each of the 
companies.</p>
<p> If I'm moving to Slide #8, you can see the results for the Strauss 
Group. 2.4% lower sales. If I'm looking on a fixed currency basis and 
excluding the sales that we have done of the sales activity in Sabra, 
you can see that we are up 2.9%.</p>
<p> Later on in Slide #9, you can see that the influence of the 
translation of -- mainly it's Brazilian sales, sorry, is responsible for
 this reductions in sale.</p>
<p> So moving to Slide #10. I can say that despite of the influence here
 also of the translation, as I said in local currency we grew the sales 
in Brazil, you can see up 0.3% in gross profit. And you can see the 
sources within the different companies. Again here, excluding the FX, 
it's a 4.4% improvement of our margins. And despite the lower -- or 
small increase in the gross profit, we're able to grow nominally 6.1% in
 EBIT. Again, here, the trend -- the multiyear trend is important, you 
can see where we are. Not that we weren't affected by the translation, 
which, again, I hope, if nothing will be changed during the rest of Q4, 
or Q4 will be in much better place as far as the translation effect.</p>
<p> I'll skip the EBITDA, which we provide for the cash flow models that you are building.</p>
<p> And looking, again, in the local performance of Sabra and Três 
Corações, I think we covered this part. But anyway, if you have later on
 questions, both Daniella and myself are here in order to answer you.</p>
<p> So moving to Slide #16. You can see the different, I would say, 
platforms. This is all those magnitude changes that we've made during 
the years. Even this quarter, 15% growth in the net profit, mainly, of 
course, coming from the growth in EBIT, but not less important is the 
reductions in the finance expenses and the taxes, and you can see the 
improvement also in the effective tax rate that we have. And remember, 
this quarter, we don't have the influence of the acquisition of the 
minorities. Also Q3 last year was already after the acquisition of the 
minorities in the coffee. So this is apples-to-apples and this is a 
trend that we are trying to keep the momentum.</p>
<p> And we have done all of it while reducing the debt level. In Slide 
#17, you can see it. Not only that we reduced the absolute amount of net
 debt, but also the leverage. So we are now in 1.8, lower than we 
expected when we announced TPG deal and this is due to a very strong 
performance in cash flow, which you can see later on by yourself in the 
operating cash flow and the cash flow. So this is as far as the third 
quarter.</p>
<p> Just to keep this call short and to allow you to have enough time to
 ask questions, the only thing that I will draw your attention in Slide 
#21 that you can see that in the 9 months, we are growing 1.5% in sales 
and 5.6% in organic mainly excluding the translation effect.</p>
<p> And again, this is -- I will jump to Slide #28. You can see our 
Brazilian operation going up 17% in EBIT, then you can understand the 
influence of Q3, sometimes it's just the timing effect of the marketing 
expenses and some of the expenses that we had due to the change of 
transportation arrangement that we have after the beginning of the year,
 the truck strike in Brazil. The rest of the parameters goes into the 
same direction as in Q3.</p>
<p> And in Slide #29, you can see that the performance of the net profit
 is in the same order of magnitude as in the third quarter. Here, by the
 way, in the 9 months, there is the effect of the minority or the deal 
that we have made in Q1 '17. Without it -- if I'll exclude the influence
 of the acquisition of the minority, we'll be around 13.5% improvement 
in net profit during the first 9 months.</p>
<p> So with that, I finished my conversation on the results. Then I will be more than happy to take any questions you might have.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Michael Klahr of Citibank.</p>
<p> MICHAEL KLAHR, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just 
wanted to ask about some of the subsidiaries and the underlying growth, 
if we could start with Brazil. In local currency, I see 4.6% 
year-on-year revenue growth, and in the previous quarter, it was 7.6%. 
And if I go back, let's say, a year, you were growing well above 20% in 
the top line. And so just trying to understand, I think you mentioned 
the prices were flat so that was all volume growth. Can you give some 
color on maybe when you were growing above 20%, what the split between 
price and volume was. And if your volume growth is slowing, why is that?
 Or if I misunderstood that.</p>
<p> SHAHAR FLORENCE: Okay. I understand that your question is about 
Brazil. If you have questions about other segments, I'll take them 
later. But starting with Brazil, for the last few years, coffee prices 
are, I won't say maybe years, but 1.5 years, maybe 2 years the prices of
 coffee are stable. This year, they are going down a little bit. In 
Brazil, they're going down. Unlike other markets that the sales price 
are, I would say, the correlation between prices of the raw commodity to
 the finished goods are not one-to-one. In Brazil, they are closer to 
one-to-one. That means that the market follow the raw material prices 
closely. And this year, due to the lower green coffee prices, our sales 
prices per kilo are lower. And as I mentioned, the growth this quarter 
was, in quantities, was more than 10%. We took market share. We went up 
from 23% to 27% -- 25%, sorry, to 27%. So if you ask me if the growth 
was slower, no, it wasn't in a long-term perspective. You can see also 
the 9 months. On the contrary, I would say that, for us, if we can sell 
in lower prices to the consumers, that means that the consumer can buy 
more. It's even better as long as we can improve the profits and 
margins. And as you can see, gross profits in the 9 months went up 
18.7%. And if I'm looking on the -- I'll just switch to the right slide 
to Slide #15. The profits went up 6.7% and profitability went up in 
Brazil. So all in all, I would say that, for us, the phenomena of lower 
green coffee prices in the long term is good, though unless it's slowing
 the nominal growth in sales. The one thing that, as I said, was a 
little bit lower in this quarter is the EBIT, which, again, I look at 
the Brazilian P&amp;L that we provide together with our financials, you 
can see that the main influence was the SG&amp;A, which we put a lot of 
emphasis in pushing our single portion activities. This is something 
else that is not related to the green coffee prices because, as I said, 
the profits and the gross profitability in single portion is much, much 
higher than any other shape or form of coffee consumption and has less, 
let' say, correlation with the green coffee prices. So bottom line for, 
Michael, your question, I don't think that we are slowing in Brazil. On 
the contrary, we keep taking market share, stronger will be as #1. The 
profits and the profitability will go up. And as far as quantity, as I 
said, more than 10% growth in volume in coffee in Brazil this quarter.</p>
<p> MICHAEL KLAHR: Okay, that's very helpful. My second question was 
about the Chinese JV and you're growing, I think, in the last couple of 
quarters at about a 10% rate there. Actually, this quarter, you grew a 
bit faster than the last quarter. My understanding was the market there,
 the water filtration market, was growing, I don't know, 30%, 40% per 
annum over the last few years. So just trying to understand are you -- 
has the market growth slowed significantly there? Are you losing share? 
Or what is happening there? What's the reason for the slower growth than
 what we've seen in the years past?</p>
<p> SHAHAR FLORENCE: First of all, a word of disclaimer. The market 
information in our segment in China is a little bit, let's say, it's 
more difficult to get an accurate number. The same as in Israel. This is
 not something that is monitored by the Nielsen -- the local Nielsen is 
called CMM in Brazil -- sorry, in China. Only part of the segment, which
 is the big electricity -- equipment retail shops are monitored. So for 
sure, it's not the whole picture of the market and the rest is that 
extrapolation, which are not always accurate on the market. So this is 
the word of disclaimer. Second thing I would say I don't think that we 
said that the market is growing 50%, 60%. There were times that we grew 
50%. But this was on, let's say, on a smaller scale of business. This is
 almost ILS 0.5 billion business a year, our business, and these numbers
 are going up. It is more difficult to grow for our, I would say, 
estimation, but it's an educated estimation based on the figures that we
 are getting from CMM, which is, again, the local agency that try to 
cover the markets and give information about the market. The market grew
 a little bit more than us, 15%, 16% growth in the market. And this is 
the reason, as I said before, we expect ourself to grow more than 10%. I
 don't think that the market has changed. There is a little bit of 
influence of the yuan rate and so on. But let's look on the market, this
 is not the main influence for us. Certainly, we expect ourselves to 
grow more than 10%. It's up to us, it's up to our performance, the 
equipment that we're selling in our sales organization. But I wouldn't 
say that the market has slowed down. I'll take the responsibility on 
ourselves, and therefore, our expectation to grow -- not expectation as 
far as predictions, but sales conduct that we are setting for ourselves 
to try and grow much more than the 10% that we published.</p>
<p> MICHAEL KLAHR: What is it, what do you need to do? Your partnered 
with Haier, you've got a very high-tech solution. What is the -- what is
 stopping you? Or what do you need to do? What aren't you doing well? 
How -- why aren't you growing faster than the market? What are the -- 
what needs to be done to get that growth rate to the faster rate?</p>
<p> SHAHAR FLORENCE: That underlying is better execution. If I'm looking
 on our plans, our digital channels are growing very good, faster than 
the average. We still have to improve it, but mainly the sales through 
the, I would say, the traditional channels, we're selling to 2 main 
channels, one is the Haier stores. Haier has a chain of stores that sell
 their products and their products only and it's including also the 
Haier Strauss Water product. And to the regular retail stores such as 
Gome and Suning. And in those channels, the traditional, regular 
channels we are weaker than in the rest. And if you ask me about one 
thing, if I need to point one thing that we need to improve is the sales
 through the traditional retail sales channel, mainly Gome and Suning 
and other retail chains like this. But the bottom line is better 
execution from ourselves. It all depends on us for good, but also for 
bad.</p>

<p> OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NXT-ID IR Update Webcast Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)</p>
<p> I would now like to turn the conference over to Gino Pereira, Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NXT-ID IR INC.: Thank you very 
much. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today to 
discuss NXT-ID's unaudited financial and operational results for the 
three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and we're going to give a
 general update on the progress of our business.</p>
<p> So during this morning's call, we'll be making forward statements 
which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to 
existing information including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, 
expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the 
assumptions underlying such statements.</p>
<p> Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause 
actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements 
including the factors identified and discussed in our SEC filings. 
Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake
 no duty to update any forward-looking statements and you should not 
place any undue reliance on such statements.</p>
<p> So with me today on the call today is Vin Miceli, our Chief 
Financial Officer; Michael Orlando, our Chief Operating Officer and 
President of FitPay; and Stanley Washington, Chief Revenue Officer and 
Head of our Healthcare division.</p>
<p> So, I'll begin the call with a summary of our progress to date and 
then turn the call over to Vin for a review of our financial results and
 to Mike and Stan for an update on payments and healthcare respectively.
 We'll then take a few calls from the analysts.</p>
<p> So, our results for the second quarter of 2018 were largely similar 
to those for the first quarter of 2018. Revenues in the first and second
 quarters were down fairly significantly compared to the same period in 
2017 but our gross profit was approximately the same. So, the 
profitability of the products that we sold were substantially increased.</p>
<p> Revenues in Q2 of 2018 were about 5% up on revenues for Q1 of 2018, 
which in turn was about 10% up on Q4 of 2017. So, we have exhibited a 
consistent quarter to quarter sales growth over the last three quarters.</p>
<p> Our expenses for Q1 and Q2 of 2018 were higher compared to the same 
period the previous year largely because of the merger with FitPay. But 
most of the increase was for R&amp;D costs for future customers and 
products, so that's really an investment in the company's future. And 
notably we saved a significant amount in interest expense with the 
conversion of the revolving credit line to a term loan as we previously 
announced earlier this year and that should significantly help us on 
cash flow.</p>
<p> On the payment side of the business, Garmin Pay is now featured in 
10 Smartwatches from Garmin and these watches carry the FitPay payment 
technology. And this is up from two watches the previous quarters, so 
that's grown pretty substantially and we continue to make progress in 
our Flip crypto conversion products. Our development work is now done 
and we're going through the certification with networks and other 
third-party certification. So, we expect to launch the product in late 
Q3, early Q4 and we also expect to have a new payment platform for 
launch in late Q4 2018 or early Q1 2019.</p>
<p> In healthcare, LogicMark continues to perform very strongly. 
Cumulatively, revenues at LogicMark had grown about 64% since we 
acquired the company about two years ago. And now, we are bringing 
LogicMark's products to a wider customer base through expanded 
distribution as well as looking to increase our penetration within our 
primary customer which is the VA.</p>
<p> We're also launching new product initiatives in the area of safety 
and security for individuals as well as telehealth monitoring. Our 
product development pipeline is really strong with a new number of -- 
with a number of new product introductions for 2019. And I believe we 
are on track to continue building our company for a combination of 
increased marketing for existing products and introducing new technology
 forward products that we feel will substantially contribute to our 
growth in the future. So that's really a high level summary of the 
progress that we've made in the last quarter.</p>
<p> And now for more detail, I will turn the call over to Vin Miceli, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p> VIN MICELI, VP AND CFO, NXT-ID IR INC.: Thank you, Gino. Good 
afternoon, everyone. I'd like to go over some of the key items, key 
highlights, if you will, on both the income statement and balance sheet 
for the company at June 30.</p>
<p> Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30 were $5.2 
million and $10.1 million respectively and compared to our revenues for 
the comparable 2017 period of $7.7 million and $14.3 million.</p>
<p> On a sequential basis revenues for the second quarter increased by 
approximately $250,000 over the first quarter 2018. The decrease in our 
revenues in both the three and six months of 2018 versus the three and 
six months of 2017 is primarily attributable to a reduction in the 
company's shipment of smart cards to WorldVentures in the 2018 period as
 compared to 2017.</p>
<p> The company's gross profit margin, excuse me, gross profit margin 
was approximately 68% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 
2018 as compared to 50% in both 2017 periods. The favorable gross margin
 in both periods was primarily attributable to the strong LogicMark 
sales that Gino alluded to earlier as well as the gross margin earned on
 the FitPay sales in both the -- well actually in Q2.</p>
<p> Our operating expenses for Q2 2018 were up about $900,000 at $4 
million as compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. And 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher R&amp;D expenses 
which came on as a -- primarily as a result of layering on the FitPay 
expenses for the full second quarter of the 2018. Whereas in 2017, we 
had them in for a partial second -- just actually it was about five 
weeks of the second quarter of 2017.</p>
<p> For the six months 2018, pretty much the same reasoning. Our 
operating expenses were about $2.6 million higher. They came in at $8.2 
million for the six months of the 2018 compared to $5.6 million a year 
ago. And again, it's primarily the layering on of the FitPay expenses 
for the full six months as opposed to just the five weeks of 2017.</p>
<p> Interest expense for both the three and six months ended June 30 
were both lower by approximately $700,000 and $1.6 million in the three 
and six months compared to 2017. The decrease was pretty much 
attributable to three factors. One, as Gino alluded to, we refinanced 
the revolver debt in Q2 to a term loan facility, so there was some 
interest savings in Q2. In addition, we had lower deferred debt issue 
cost to amortization in the six months of 2018 versus 2017. And we also 
had lower note discount from the conversion of the exchange notes that 
we had back in 2017.</p>
<p> The net loss for the three and six months ended June 30 was 
approximately $1 million and $2.6 million compared to $1.2 million and 
$1.9 million for the comparable 2017 periods. During the six months 
ended June 30, 2018, the company's net loss included about $1.5 million 
in non-cash charges.</p>
<p> Moving over to our balance sheet, just some of the major captions. 
Cash at the end of June, we ended with cash of $1.3 million. We had 
approximately $2.5 million of favorable working capital. As we already 
discussed, we refinanced the revolver debt. We should have some very 
nice savings prospectively from the interest rate -- from the savings on
 the interest rate reduction. And lastly, equity was about $18.1 million
 at June 30.</p>
<p> So with that, I'll turn it back over to Gino for more discussion.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Thanks, Vin. I think we'll move to Mike Orlando now to bring us up to date on what's been going on at FitPay.</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO, COO AND PRESIDENT OF FIT PAY INC., NXT-ID IR INC.: 
Thanks, Gino. Good afternoon, everyone. So Gino provided some highlights
 in terms of what has been taking place during Q2 in the payments 
business. First and foremost, there's been the number of new devices 
that Garmin has launched in the market. As Gino mentioned, we grew from 2
 devices to 10 and it really crosses across a number of different 
product categories for Garmin.</p>
<p> So, we're touching everything today from with the Garmin Pay 
functionality powered by FitPay, we are touching everything from mass 
market, fitness watches, which is the vivoactive 3, the one that we 
launched with all the way into their aviation line that they just 
released here at the end of June or early July timeframe.</p>
<p> So for us, we're seeing an increase in activations. If anyone is 
curious on what Garmin's results, they've seen a 24% increase in 
smartwatch sales from quarter over quarter, year over year. And so we're
 to a certain extent benefiting from that growth rate as those new 
devices begin to gain market share and all those new devices have Garmin
 Pay as an active feature in there.</p>
<p> In addition, we continue to grow our footprint for Garmin Pay on the
 FitPay platform. We are in 25 different countries today and over 170 
banks and that's an increase of about 8 countries, about 35 banks over 
the last 90 days or so. So, that momentum continues to build and as we 
look to geographies and continents, I think we are on -- we have a 
penetration and activity in virtually every continent except for Latin 
America today and that will be coming later this quarter.</p>
<p> When you look at our other products and other development works that
 we've been working on, certainly Flip is something where we spent a lot
 of time of both on the R&amp;D and also on the business development 
side, putting together partnerships and relationships that we need to do
 to create that cryptocurrency to USD conversion products.</p>
<p> And so we've completed the hardware development and all the software
 and application development that was required, and it's pretty 
intensive. We had to build a new wallet experience. We had to create 
integration to an exchange platform, develop new relationship with 
banking partners, work with the network partners to sponsor the bitcoin 
to USD conversion on their brand and then go through the process of 
getting all of that developed into a very clean sleek user experience.</p>
<p> So all that work is done, inclusive of the hardware coins, the Flip 
coin which will be first device that's out there and currently the 
device is in the certification process. We have to go through a pretty 
intensive certification process to ensure interoperability of that 
device across all the terminals globally and then also part of the 
solution insurance process with the network. And we expect that to be 
done in the next four to five weeks and then we will be shipping first 
units by the end of Q3 is our target.</p>
<p> And then in addition to that, we're continuing to develop and work 
with our partners on new use cases for our tokenization platform and we 
will be looking to announce and have some new business offerings and 
revenue models coming out towards the end of this year and beginning of 
2019.</p>
<p> And with that, Gino, I will turn it back to Stan, I think.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Yes. Stan?</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON, CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT OF 
HEALTHCARE, NXT-ID IR INC.: Thank you, Mike and Gino. On the LogicMark 
front, LogicMark continues to perform well. 2018 is off to our strongest
 start with the company performing at over 10% over last year. The VA 
continues to drive the majority of our revenue and our profit and we are
 continuing to enjoy a very strong area of opportunity within the VA as 
well.</p>
<p> Gross margin has continued to increase and this is due to a shift in
 our product mix, again primarily at the VA. And we've been able to 
maintain our headcount year-to-date that is pretty much flat and we've 
been building our operations primarily through scale by demand -- on 
demand.</p>
<p> For 2018 revenue of -- the LogicMark business has been performing at
 about $8.7 million year-to-date. We are at over 4,000 units sold 
through Q2 and our gross margin is roughly at 73.6%, so the business 
again has been performing very, very well in this particular market.</p>
<p> We continue to maintain a -- our primary supplier position within 
the VA. This has been a really strong effort by our sales force and the 
grassroots effort that we have within the VA overall. This has also 
allowed us to identify new opportunities to expand products and to 
deliver new offerings. We're in the process of developing a very strong 
R&amp;D roadmap which we would utilize to continue to strengthen our 
position as the no fee, no contract product in the marketplace, a very 
strong position which we currently enjoy.</p>
<p> As we look forward, LogicMark really has four primary areas of focus
 that we're really looking to continue to drive both on our government 
sector which specifically is where we're servicing the VA. We are 
continuing to drive our medical alert business. This business is very 
robust and there is a significant amount of penetration still available 
within the VA and with other verticals within that group as well, the 
DoD and other types of key business opportunities there.</p>
<p> From a commercial standpoint, we're really moving hard into some 
emerging categories. This includes safety and security, panic buttons 
which really are starting to gain quite a bit of momentum in the 
marketplace with that in the hospitality industry, in the real estate 
industry and other interesting emerging categories. This really lends 
itself to a good utility of our current devices and gives us an 
opportunity to continue to grow revenue and to acquire new revenue -- 
new market share.</p>
<p> We also believe we have a great opportunity to be disruptive within 
retail, again having a dominant position from a no contract, no fee 
standpoint with a large percentage of the marketplace being a monitored 
monthly subscription business. We think this gives us a real advantage 
and gives consumers an alternative to having to pay a monthly fee.</p>
<p> And then finally we are, as we've discussed previously, really 
working towards new solutions in data connectivity and in overall 
solutions for the home healthcare industry, specifically in telehealth 
and telemedicine. We think this is a really strong growth opportunity 
for LogicMark and we anticipate having strong alliances and partnerships
 as we move into 2019 and are looking to launch our new products at that
 time as well.</p>
<p> Gino, that's it for right now on LogicMark.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Okay, thank you. So as we've heard, for the period of 
three months we've made a tremendous amount of progress which is not 
entirely reflected in the actual numbers that we see, but we believe 
very strongly that we are building a strong platform on both sides for 
growth going forward and we're excited about that.</p>
<p> So, I think at this point we can take some calls from analysts, please.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from 
Brian Kinstlinger of Alliance Global Partners. Your line is now open.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER, ANALYST, ALLIANCE GLOBAL PARTNERS: I appreciate 
all the information on LogicMark, but I did miss it because there was a 
blip there for a second. I think you guys mentioned the revenue run rate
 of LogicMark. I think it was up 10%, you gave the gross margins, but I 
missed the revenue, if you could just repeat that?</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: Yes, currently, the run rate is reflecting a 10% growth in 2018 versus 2017.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Right. But I think you actually gave a revenue number, am I mistaken and I misunderstood?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: I think Stan mentioned a revenue number to date. Stanley?</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON: Yes. Overall, year-to-date revenue at LogicMark is up over about $8 million.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Over $8 million. Great, that's helpful. Okay, so 
I'm curious, it's been a great recovery for the last two quarters in 
terms of building back the business up. Can you talk about what's 
driving that growth? Is it the payments division, is it LogicMark? If 
it's both, can you talk about how the weighting has occurred?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Yes, so I'll take that question. So, we're building 
both -- so the blip is basically down to one customer that we had in the
 payments division where the demand dropped off fairly quickly. But that
 didn't really change anything or derail us from the basic platform and 
initiatives that we have.</p>
<p> So, we really just kind stuck to our guns and just continue to 
develop the technologies that we have, with the vision that we have. So 
on the healthcare front, it's a strong profitable division. It's more 
mature than the payments division and so that definitely drives a lot 
more of the -- within that unit, it's highly profitable. And so, we're 
looking at ways to expand within the segment that we are currently very 
successful in as well as expanding distribution outside. We think there 
is lot of growth for that.</p>
<p> And from the beginning, our intention when we acquired LogicMark 
which was a fairly traditional personal emergency response business was 
how do we take this traditional business and bring it into 21st century 
with -- in the world of IoT and connected devices and the new products 
that we're working on are going to do exactly that.</p>
<p> So, we think we are -- we are very hopeful we're in a -- that we 
will be in a very -- in a technology leading position when these 
products are launched and that should help us with further growth as 
well as expand the potential markets that we see our products in.</p>
<p> And then on FinTech side, Flip has obviously made great strides in 
terms of penetration launches and this one is more of a slow roll to get
 to revenue. It's a tremendous business as it builds out but it's a 
slower roll as we need to form alliances with large vendors like Garmin 
and those contracts definitely take time. We have a number in the works,
 we've said that before. Some of these are actually closed and we can't 
announce until the partner itself launches its product. And then, it's 
just a question of time, as with a bit more penetration, we get more 
activations and then that generates more revenue, but that's definitely 
more of slow roll build.</p>
<p> But having said that, FitPay itself is in great position in terms of
 its technology platform because other than -- people like other 
manufactures of products like Apple and Samsung, Fitbit and Google, we 
are the only really independent payment platform supplier which is -- 
gives us access to companies like Garmin and other large manufacturers 
of watches or other IoT devices that would like to have digital payments
 as part of their platform.</p>
<p> And so we're kind of a go-to for that, let's say this -- it's a bit 
of slow roll as we bring these customers on and they are large 
complicated arrangements. But for the long term, we're very confident 
that it's a solid successful business, so that's really what we're 
focused on and how we're developing the business.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: And I appreciate that, that's a great forward 
[look]. What I just want to understand also is, you've grown 20% from 
the bottom in the fourth quarter sequential over the last six months on a
 quarterly basis. It seems to me if LogicMark is growing 10% that can 
only contribute about half the growth, whereas the payments business as a
 whole, is that right, is contributing about half the growth or is that 
not accurate so far?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Well, it's just in terms of the second quarter there 
was definitely an increased contribution from the payments business, 
right, as we had more activations coming on, we (inaudible) more. And as
 Mike mentioned, we've seen activation growth almost on a weekly basis 
with new Garmin customers.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Right, so that was my next question actually.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Yes. So we expect that to continue.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Can you quantify the impact, I mean of Garmin 
activations either from your revenue or have they given numbers on 
activation rates? And I know 24% year over year growth is what they have
 in your active is what was said by I think [Chris] in their watches, 
but they actually have to be activated. So, are you cleared all by 
activation rates and what has been the contribution maybe in a quarter 
if you are able to provide that?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: So I think around that, why do we take -- Mike, do you
 want to speak a little bit to it to how you've seen the activation 
rates grow over the last few quarters?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes. So Garmin doesn't release product specific 
information, we talk about growth rates in the categories in general. I 
think for us as we've seen the activity grow, it's really been around 
the devices that have entered the market. So as mentioned, they're going
 from 2 to 10 and then the number of banks, particularly when we added 
Chase and PayCentre in Germany and open up that market and so that 
happened late in the second quarter, so mid-June is when those happened.
 And we saw during that first 7-to 10-day period about a 25% to 30% 
increase in our activations and that's continued to grow over time, so 
-- and continue to click up on a weekly basis.</p>
<p> So, we're encouraged by the growth of the global activity that 
happens and it's both enabling it for new customers. That's what we do 
with the banks and then when more people buy watches, so it's really 
this kind of inflection point that we're starting to see in terms of 
overall activation rates.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Right. Well then seeing that those banks were at 
the [end] of June and also seeing that we have the holiday season in 
December, should we see a -- should we expect a significant increase in 
contributions from Garmin in the second half of the year in (multiple 
speakers)?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: It will be a combination of -- yes, it will be -- I
 think it will be a combination of again continue to grow our footprint.
 Garmin continues to sell more and then we also expect to have another 
one to two devices that will be launched before holiday season. [Tokin],
 one that we've spoken about on previous calls, expects their first 
shipments to happen prior to the holiday and then we've got a couple of 
other fashion branded devices that will launch in the first of -- first 
part of Q4, all in time for holiday. So the timing for --</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: [Who are those two] new devices from?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: We haven't launched. We haven't announced in Asia. 
We will when those products at the market in the first part of Q1 -- Q4 
excuse me.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: But they're Tier 1 OEMs?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: They're Tier 1 fashion watches.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Oh got you, okay. And then --</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: -- maybe you can provide an update on 
WorldVentures. Do we expect Flye card sales will -- there will be 
additional sales this year or at all going forward or do you think that 
relationship has run its course?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: I think where we see it is, it will continue to be 
flat to down. We're working closely with WorldVentures on current 
inventory and trying to move that inventory through the membership 
channel and then what could be next in terms of product solutions for 
them, so the relationship is still there. We can continue to help them 
get the products out into their membership base and then as I said 
continue to develop the dialogue around, are there other things that we 
might be able to do together in the future.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: So a modest amount of revenue for them?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Yes. And then finally, I just want to make sure I
 understood with $1.3 million on the balance sheet, did I understand -- I
 can't remember who said it, but there was $2.5 million favorable 
working capital adjustment, is that after the quarter close, so you've 
got $3.8 million minus maybe half a million cash burn per month?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: No, I think that statement from Vin, was that was just
 a statement on the positive working capital on the balance sheet at 
(inaudible).</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: So the $1.3 million wasn't benefited after the quarter by any collections or anything like that?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Correct.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Yes.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Well, I mean regular -- is close of business collection.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Right. Okay, thank you.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kris Tuttle of SoundView Technology Group. Your line is now open.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE, ANALYST, SOUNDVIEW TECHNOLOGY GROUP: I just have a few 
and I'll try to organize them. I'll start with payments. So can you 
comment on you talked about Flip in terms of its likely shipping 
timeframe, can you give us some sort of feel for what the pre-orders 
were for that or are and then what kind of capacity do you have for 
actually delivering the Flip product let's say on a monthly or a 
quarterly basis?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes, so we've been in pre-order mode for about four
 months. It's been relatively steady, although we've not spent a ton of 
resources or advertising on building the pre-orders as we kind of get 
closer to shipments. And then I think the other piece for us is then a 
lot of online and social media outlets have limited our ability to 
advertise, so we're looking at and trying new ways of getting the 
product out there.</p>
<p> As we mentioned in our release earlier in the quarter, we sent a 
distribution agreement with the musical artists to help us reach a new 
category of customer. Those that have a very strong bias towards 
cryptocurrency and that actually gave us a nice boost in terms of 
pre-orders and so we'll continue to look for other distribution partners
 to keep that going.</p>
<p> And in terms of capacity, we don't feel capacity will be any issue 
for us, our supplier on the chip side is the manufacturer of the 
physical hardware chips and the antennas that are there has -- it's a 
top tier provider, so we don't see capacity issues with that at all. In 
fact, we've already set up the pre-orders to fulfill what we would 
expect to be orders through the end of the year. And then the 
manufacturing ODM partner has commitments to us to produce what we need 
to in terms of minimal order quantity, so I think we're all -- we're set
 in terms of fulfilling the demand that we expect through 2018 with the 
Flip product.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: And what's the cycle time on when you order product and when it actually is available for sale?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes, so once we begin shipments that would be -- 
there's no delay right, we'll go straight to fulfillment. Our order to 
delivery time from our ODM is about two weeks, so pretty short 
timeframe.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. Okay. And just to confirm the -- when you 
actually start shipping this product, you will have customers who 
receive it will be able to link at least one of the --</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Right.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: -- recognized bitcoin service providers like the Coinbase or something like that on day one?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes, they'll be able to link their bitcoin account 
from their bitcoin provider through their wallet so we'll -- they'll be 
able to link their current bitcoin wallet from whoever that provider is 
to our wallet and do the exchange to USD. There will only be bitcoin. We
 won't be accepting any other cryptocurrency at launch.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. And one other question on the payment side, I've 
noticed Google Pay made a little bit of progress and I was wondering if 
you could just --</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: -- give us a couple of bullet points on how FitPay is differentiated from Google Pay for an ODM.</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes, sure. So I think our value proposition to the 
OEMs and the manufacturers of the devices is that we're platform and 
operating system agnostic. So Google Pay only works in the context of 
having Android Wear as part of the operating system on either your -- in
 your smartwatch or your other devices. So for the likes of Garmin, who 
has built their entire portfolio of products around their own 
proprietary operating system, that wouldn't work for them.</p>
<p> Secondly for those that are looking to only add payments as part of 
the new capabilities of their fashion watch and not add all the 
smartwatch capabilities that are part of that, Google Pay would not be a
 solution for them.</p>
<p> And then the third advantage we have is that Google Pay operates in 
what's called host card emulation mode and that requires different level
 of certification, a different level of encryption that they need to 
build inside the device and a lot more horsepower to operate where our 
platform operates with a Secure Element. So it's a different -- so 
hardware enclave that it doesn't require the same power capabilities and
 memory draw that a Google Pay or a host card emulation payment system 
would require.</p>
<p> And so from those perspective, we think we have a very striking 
advantage when we're talking to device manufacturer because they're 
going to want to focus on their own operating system and that puts the 
Android Wear and then Google Pay off to the side and also look to reduce
 their cost and development times by using a Secure Element versus a 
software encryption model.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Right. Is that Secure Element -- I mean is it fair to 
say it's -- because it's in the hardware right, it's more secure?</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: That's debatable.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: I mean there's a lot of different opinions on that,
 so it's just the hardware enclave, where it sits on versus creating an 
encryption model on their and in either way I mean they've all been 
certified by their networks. So some tend -- some of those folks in our 
market tend to think that Secure Element is more secure. Others believe 
that the software is equally as secure, so I can't formulate an opinion 
on that myself.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. All right. Thanks, Chris. Moving on to LogicMark,
 I was curious to know I know you've been working on some additional 
channels for the LogicMark in the retail and what should we -- how 
should we think about the LogicMark revenue outside of the VA in six 
months and a year and a half, is it 5% to 10%? Is it 30% to 40% outside 
of VA in a year? How should we think about the growth in non-VA channels
 for the LogicMark product line?</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON: That's a good question, Kris. Let me answer in 
two ways. First, let me say that within the VA, we think there is 
significantly more growth opportunity, so we think we have a lot more 
room to run there as well and we're not as deeply penetrated as we're 
capable of being.</p>
<p> That being said, we think the opportunities for growth outside of 
the VA specifically within the security and safety category with all the
 momentum that is happening today around the panic buttons in 
particular, you'll see -- we're starting to see cities and states pass 
legislation mandating the use of panic buttons by hospitality providers.
 I think you're going to continue to see that in other categories as 
well.</p>
<p> So we think that there is a significant amount of growth for us in 
these areas through these channels as we get into 2019. I think that's 
plus 10% in the follow-up question. I'll be reluctant -- hesitant rather
 I think now that I put a firm number on it because we're still building
 out our strategic plan in terms of how we're going to attack those 
markets. We're in discussions now with enterprise partners who have the 
distribution capability to help us push products out. And we are really I
 think narrowing down where we think the best bets are going to be made,
 but most certainly we're moving very aggressively into that particular 
channel and we are, Gino indicated earlier, developing products right 
now that we think are based on our core capability, our core product 
set, but have I think unique features and benefits, which we'll be able 
to serve that particular market.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. I mean the -- some of the things that you talked 
about in terms of market opportunity, I mean we follow the digital 
health space pretty closely and it's a -- there's a staggering amount of
 activity and opportunity out there right now.</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON: Yes.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: In terms of resources, are you looking at -- are you 
actively looking at potentially some small acquisitions to help you guys
 get to market sooner in some of these areas?</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON: Yes, another good question, Kris. What I -- go ahead, Gino. I'll piggyback on what you comment.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Sure. So in terms of acquisition, there's not -- we 
don't really base our growth strategy on acquisitions. We're on the 
lookout for acquisitions that can contribute to the bottom line and to 
quicker growth and we're certainly not looking at early stage 
acquisitions that would require lead time to get to market.</p>
<p> Having said that, we've done in this -- particular sector, we've 
done a fair amount of work ourselves in developing a suite of telehealth
 monitoring products that we will be talking more about in the coming 
months and that product development is very far along and so -- and 
we've also identified potential partners to start doing testing with and
 doing some initial rollout of these products.</p>
<p> So it's not necessarily -- it's not really acquisition-based, but 
definitely in terms of how it gets implemented, it will be not us going 
out selling things one by one, it will actually be a partnership with 
the much larger group that will be pushing the product out and [all 
that] stands to benefit from the use of the product.</p>
<p> STANLEY WASHINGTON: Yes, okay. I would --</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Yes, that sounds exciting. I'm eager to see -- that 
sounds -- that will be very exciting progress to have those kind of 
products in the market.</p>
<p> I think my last question here just a couple of housekeeping things 
on the balance sheet. So it looks like you're making some good progress 
on -- I mean AR was flat I believe quarter over quarter, but it looks 
like you guys collected a good chunk from older age AR, I think 
WorldVentures dropped considerably quarter to quarter, is that a 
sustainable kind of improvement in AR from them?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: So I'll pick that up. Yes, I think the AR situation 
continues to improve and we expect it to continue in the next few 
quarters.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. That's excellent and can you give us an update 
just where does the cash balance stand sort of June 30 seems like a long
 time ago now, just here in mid-August?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: When we do --</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: So right now, we're just --</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Go ahead.</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: -- it's pretty flat, Kris. We've been --</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay.</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: -- right in that [$1.3 million to $1.5 million] range.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. And do you have a little room on the revolver 
just from a working capital standpoint? I don't know if that's exactly 
we were talking about then with the [$2.5 million], but if you guys just
 -- just to give you some operating flexibility, you have a little room 
on that to take it up and down as you need?</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: So the revolver facility that we had in place with [ex 
works] has been refinanced out if you will and we're with the term loan 
facility only now.</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay, so it's fixed except for when you -- payments that you made.</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: Exactly. Except for any --</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay.</p>
<p> VIN MICELI: -- future pay downs or --</p>
<p> KRIS TUTTLE: Okay. Okay. Excellent. I get it. Well, that's all I 
have. I have to say it's really great on the huge interest rate 
reduction and all the progress on the products. I know we're going to 
see the revenues kind of forthcoming on some of these, but I don't know,
 it's great job I guess, worth saying, so we'll talk to you again soon.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Diana of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.</p>
<p> MICHAEL DIANA, ANALYST, MAXIM GROUP: Well as you might imagine most 
of my questions have been asked. I was interested though in some of the 
other questions related to sort of the timing of the new products. Most 
of the products, new products you talked about you expect some 
contribution in 2019, is that right?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: I think yes, that's correct for this. I mean we expect
 some contribution in -- we expect some contribution potentially late in
 2018, but there's definitely -- it's difficult for us to predict 
exactly when they're going to start to get going, so we're really 
focused on them as 2019 product launches, but we're also aiming to 
target to get some of these -- some product revenues from new products 
late in 2018.</p>
<p> MICHAEL DIANA: Okay, great. And let me just ask one more sort of 
more specific question. I missed the name of the German Bank that you 
signed up at the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: It's PayCentre.</p>
<p> MICHAEL DIANA: PayCentre. Okay.</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes.</p>
<p> MICHAEL DIANA: So okay and that's what's sort of triggered some activations in Germany of (multiple speakers) --</p>
<p> MICHAEL ORLANDO: Yes. Yes, yes, so there were -- yes, so we were the
 first pay wallet to launch in Germany. (Inaudible) [Pay] has followed 
us in the last couple of weeks, but we're the first one to launch in 
Germany.</p>
<p> PayCentre is a large issued prepaid and debit card portfolio across 
retailers and fuel card platforms and so they're a really large 
distribution model and those we've seen like I say [quite] an uptick in 
activations from that group in general and then Germany is a 
well-developed contactless market as well.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instruction) We do have a follow-up 
question from Brian Kinstlinger of Alliance Global Partners. Your line 
is now open.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: I think you mentioned it and I could be mistaken 
and I couldn't type fast enough. What did you say the expense of the 
FitPay was right now? Do you -- did you give that really?</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: We didn't specifically call out --</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: You didn't.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: -- the expenses of FitPay. We just mentioned that the 
-- most of the increase in spend of over the prior year was attributable
 to FitPay expenses, which are also primarily R&amp;D expenses for 
future product developments and future customers. So you might be able 
to do -- you can probably do a little bit of math and back into it, it 
will give you a pretty good idea.</p>
<p> BRIAN KINSTLINGER: Okay, I thought I missed [that part]. Thank you.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. And this does conclude our question and answer 
session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gino Pereira for
 any closing remarks.</p>
<p> GINO PEREIRA: Thank you very much. So as you can see, we've been 
hard at work and I think we've made some really good progress on a 
number of fronts and we're going to continue to push hard to move the 
business forward and we look forward to speaking to everybody else in 
another quarter. Thank you very much.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in 
today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all

<p> OPERATOR: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: Thank you, all, for joining us for China XD Plastics First
 Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me on the call 
today are Mr. Jie Han, Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer; Mr. 
Qingwei Ma, Chief Operating Officer; Mr. Taylor Zhang, Chief Financial 
Officer; Mr. Junjie Ma, Chief Technology Officer; Dr. Kenan Gong, 
General Manager of the Dubai subsidiary; and Mr. Rujun Dai, General 
Manager of the Heilongjiang subsidiary.</p>
<p> Earlier today, China XD Plastics issued a press release announcing 
the first quarter 2018 results. Before management's presentation, I 
would like to refer to the Safe Harbor statements in connection with 
today's conference call and remind our listeners that the management's 
prepared remarks during the call may contain forward-looking statements,
 which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and that management may 
make additional forward-looking statements in response to your 
questions.</p>
<p> All statements other than statements of historical facts contained 
are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the 
company's growth potential in the international markets; the 
effectiveness and the profitability of the company's product 
diversification; the impact of the company's product mix shift to more 
advanced products and the related pricing policies; the volatility of 
the company's operating results and the financial conditions; the 
company's projections of performance in 2018; and other risks detailed 
in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are
 available on its website, www.sec.gov. These forward-looking statements
 involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on 
current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the 
company and the industry. The company, therefore, claims the protection 
of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements that is contained in 
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
<p> Actual results may differ from those discussed today, and I will 
refer you to our more detailed discussion for the risks and 
uncertainties in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. In addition, any projection as to the company's filings -- 
as to the company's future performance represents management's estimates
 as of today, May 10, 2018. China XD Plastics assumes no obligation to 
update those projections in the future as market conditions change.</p>
<p> To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with the
 U.S. GAAP, management will make additional reference to earnings before
 interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which 
we refer to as EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure reconciled
 from net income, which the company believes to provide a meaningful 
additional information to better understand its operating performance. A
 table reconciling net income to EBITDA can be found on the earnings 
press release issued earlier today.</p>
<p> I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and the Chief
 Executive Officer, Mr. Han. Mr. Han will be speaking in Chinese, and I 
will translate his opening remarks into English. Mr. Han, please go 
ahead. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, CHINA XD PLASTICS COMPANY LIMITED: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: Thank you, Anna. Thank you, all, for joining us today. 
We're pleased with our quarter results. Both top and the bottom line 
growth as well as the margin improvement. In addition, an improvement in
 macroeconomic environment has improved business conditions, and we are 
well-positioned to execute our strategic plans.</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: We are particularly pleased that you see major revenue 
contributions from major new growth structures, fostered in large part 
by the gradual ramp-up of our Sichuan manufacturing facility, a key 
milestone in our Corporate Development. The new facility also extends 
our geographical reach and accelerates our market penetration beyond our
 established Northeast base, evidenced by our strong and consistent 
growth from Southwest, Central, North and the South China.</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: With Sichuan facility, the potential expands the footprint
 of our auto business in China and that we expect that automotive 
applications will continue to be our core business. The new facility 
includes the precision equipment, which will enable us to diversify our 
product platform into such high-growth verticals as ships, high-speed 
rail, airplanes, biodegradable materials, medical-grade materials, food 
packaging, electronic equipment, electrical products, alternative energy
 applications and our power devices, which will help to propel the 
company's growth.</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: Our new facility in Dubai also extends our specialized 
high-tech products into an important new market. We are planning to 
complete installing 45 production lines, with 12,000 metric tons of 
annual production capacity by the end of May 2018, and an additional 50 
production lines with 13,000 metric tons of annual production capacity 
by the end of 2018. This will bring the total installed production 
capacity in our Dubai facility to 25,000 metric tons. The Dubai facility
 will target high-end products for the overseas markets and it will 
ultimately, enable more active inroads into the markets of Europe, the 
Middle East, Russia and other international regions, with several global
 top customers in Automotive sector.</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: China XD continues to value our deep working relationships
 with our customers above all and is committed to creating value with 
our culture of hard work and innovation. We anticipate that the 
continued execution of our strategic plan, supported by an increase in 
our production capacity, our entry into new markets, our diversified 
customer base and our diversification with international sales will help
 to generate business growth for years to come. For fiscal year 2018, we
 are reiterating our financial guidance of between USD 1.2 billion and 
USD 1.4 billion in revenue and USD 90 million and USD 110 million in net
 income.</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: With that, I will now turn the call over to Taylor Zhang, 
our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through our financials.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE, CFO, SECRETARY &amp; DIRECTOR, CHINA XD PLASTICS COMPANY
 LIMITED: Thank you, Mr. Han. Thank you, Anna, and thank you, everyone, 
for joining the call today. Before I review the numbers, let me remind 
you that all figures I discuss are for this reporting period, the first 
quarter of 2018, unless I state otherwise. Additionally, any 
year-over-year comparison is to the first quarter of 2017 and any 
sequential comparison is to the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<p> So let's go over our first quarter results. Revenues were $310.5 
million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $237.8 million for the
 same period last year, representing an increase of $72.7 million or 
30.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase of 
24.4% in sales volume. A depreciation of U.S. dollar against RMB by 8% 
and offset by a decrease of 3% in the average RMB selling price of our 
products, as compared with those of last year.</p>
<p> PRC domestic revenue increased by $72.6 million in the first quarter
 of this year compared to the same period of last year, as a result of 
increase of 24.4% in sales volume, as we mentioned. And so as 
depreciation of U.S. dollar against RMB. According to China Association 
of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile sales in China increased by 2.8%
 for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017. 
An improvement in macroeconomic conditions since 2017 has improved 
business conditions and eased pricing pressures in our industry. Driven 
by accelerating growth of 7.6% in Northeast China, 184% in Central 
China, 124% in South China, 89% in Southwest China, 26% in North China 
and 22% in East China, our domestic sales during the 3 months ended 
March 31, 2018, increased by 30.5% as compared to the same period last 
year. As for RMB selling price, the company also implemented a marketing
 strategy of offering lower-end products with some lower RMB pricing to 
further penetrate the new regional markets in Central China, Southwest 
and other areas in China.</p>
<p> For the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, revenues from overseas was 
$54,854 as compared to 0 of that in last year. The company has tried to 
develop new customers overseas besides the existing customers overseas. 
The sales with this customer was suspended due to account receivable 
balance overdue situation. As end of first quarter this year, the 
customer has outstanding balance of $48.3 million, including $5.8 
million, which was 3 to 6 months past due, $32.4 million was overdue for
 less than 3 months. Customer expected to pay off the outstanding 
balance by June 2018. As the accounts receivable balance was overdue, 
the company suspended the sales to the customer in the first quarter of 
this year according to the company's standard policy.</p>
<p> Premium products, namely PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy, PLA, POM and PPO,
 in total, accounted for 81.1% in revenues in the first quarter of this 
year, compared to 81.3% for the same period last year. Gross profit was 
$53.9 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 
$34.8 million in the same period of last year, representing an increase 
of $19.1 million or 54.9%. Our gross margin increased to 17.4% for the 
first quarter of this year from 14.6% for the same period of last year, 
driven by higher gross margin of higher-end products in domestic markets
 for the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p> G&amp;A expenses were $8.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 
2018, compared to $7.1 million in the same period of last year, 
representing an increase of 25.4% or $1.8 million. This increase is 
primarily due to the increase of $0.9 million salary and welfare, which 
was due to an increase of the number of management and general staff 
from supporting departments and increase of $0.9 million in professional
 fee.</p>
<p> R&amp;D expenses were $5 million for the first quarter of 2018 
compared to $5.9 million for the first period of 2017, representing a 
decrease of $0.9 million or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily due to the
 decrease of raw material used by Heilongjiang Xinda Group for its 
research activities. As of March 31, 2018, the number of ongoing 
Research and Development projects were 326.</p>
<p> Operating income was $38.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 
compared to $21.3 million for the same period of last year, representing
 an increase of $17.6 million or 82.6%. This increase is primarily due 
to the increased gross profits, lower R&amp;D expenses, partially offset
 by higher G&amp;A expenses and selling expenses.</p>
<p> Net interest expense was $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2018
 compared to net interest expense of $8.8 million for the same period of
 2017, representing an increase of $1.8 million or 20.5%. This increase 
is primarily due to: first, an increase of average short-term and 
long-term loan balance in amount of $854.2 million for the 3 months 
ended March 31, 2018, compared to $785.4 million for the same period 
last year; partially offset by the decrease of interest expense 
resulting from average loan interest rates decreased to 4.72% for the 3 
months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 4.77% of the same period last 
year; and third, the increase of average deposit balance in the amount 
of $626.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to
 $485.3 million for the same period last year; and number 4, the 
increase of interest income resulting from average deposit interest 
rates increased to 1.5% for the first quarter of this year compared to 
1.2% of the same period last year.</p>
<p> Income tax expense was $6.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, 
representing an effective income tax rate of 24.5% compared to income 
tax expense of $3.6 million in the same period of last year, 
representing an effective income tax rate of 26.4%. The effective income
 tax rates reduced from 26.4% for the 3 months period ended March 31, 
2017, to 24.5% for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2018, is primarily
 due to a decrease of continuous operating loss occurred in overseas 
subsidiaries, and partially offset by a decrease of Sichuan Xinda's 
profit before tax ratio. The effective income tax rate for the 3 months 
ended March 31, 2018, differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 
25% primarily due to Sichuan Xinda's preferential income tax rates and 
R&amp;D 50% additional deduction of major PRC operating entities.</p>
<p> Net income was $19.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared 
to $9.9 million for the same period of last year, representing an 
increase of $9.2 million or 92.9%. Basic and diluted earnings per share 
for the 3 months period ended March 31, 2018, was $0.29 compared to 
$0.15 per basic and diluted shares for the same period last year. The 
average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted 
earnings per share in the current quarter was $49.7 (sic) [49.7] million
 compared to 49.5 million shares for the basic and diluted earnings per 
share in the prior year period.</p>
<p> EBITDA was $49.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 
$34 million for the same period last year, representing an increase of 
$15.6 million or 45.9%. For a detailed reconciliation of EBITDA, a 
non-GAAP measure, to nearest GAAP equivalent, please see financial 
tables at the end of our press release issued early today.</p>
<p> Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2018, the 
company had $564.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
 and time deposits, a decrease of about $43.3 million or 7.1% as 
compared to $608.1 million as of December 31, 2017. As of end of first 
quarter 2018, working capital was $110.1 million and the current ratio 
was 1.1, as compared to the current ratio of 1 as of December 31, 2017. 
Stockholder's equity as of March 31, 2018, was $761.6 million, an 
increase of $48.8 million or 6.8% as compared to $712.8 million at the 
end of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p> Accounts receivable decreased by 36.3% or $108.6 million due to the 
management efforts to collect outstanding balances due from the domestic
 customers. Inventories increased by 32.1% as a result of more purchases
 of raw material and the company's strategy to stock up the finished 
goods for the upcoming orders.</p>
<p> As the company released -- reiterates its financial guidance for 
fiscal 2018 to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in revenue, 
gross profits in fiscal 2018 is expected to remain stable as compared to
 that of fiscal 2017. The company project net income to range between 
$90 million and $110 million. This is based on anticipation of a steady 
recovery throughout the Chinese automotive supply chain and a 
stabilization of crude oil pricing and its impact on polymer composite 
materials in this year. This forecast also assumes contribution from 
Sichuan plants and Dubai second phase project, which will be completed 
by the end of second quarter 2018 and end of 2018, respectively. It also
 assumes the average exchange rates of U.S. dollar to RMB at 6.3, and 
this financial guidance reflects the company's preliminary view of its 
business outlook for fiscal 2018 and is subject to revision based on 
changing market conditions at any time.</p>
<p> Before we open to the call to questions, I would like to note that 
for any question directed to management in China, I'll translate both 
their questions and their answers. If you want to ask a question in 
Chinese, please also ask it in English for the benefit of our other 
listeners. Please also note that we'll only be able to respond to 
questions about financial and operating results. For other matters, 
including the going-private offer, we refer you to our already issued 
press releases. We will not be able to respond to questions that are 
directed to the principle or to the going-private offer about the 
proposed transaction.</p>
<p> With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) (foreign language) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Cooper. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Taylor, can you guys hear me?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Hi, Jason. We can hear you.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Firstly, I'd like to go over the time line for the 
capacity ramp-up. I know you mentioned that Dubai, the first phase 
should come online at the end of this month and the second phase at the 
end of this year. With respect to Sichuan Phase 1, which is 300,000 
metric tons of primarily Automobile capacity, is that still scheduled to
 come online by the end of this quarter?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes, Jason. That is still the schedule that we are taking on.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. And what about the upgrading of 100,000 metric tons in Harbin. Is that still this summer?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Jason, let me confirm with our management in China about this upgrading in Harbin. (foreign language)</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Hi, Jason. The upgrade in Harbin facility is still as we expected and scheduled previously.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. With respect to Phase 2 of Sichuan, which is 
300,000 metric tons of biodegradable plastics, is that coming online by 
the end of this year?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: All right. Jason, let me also confirm that as well. (foreign language)</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So Jason, there may be possibly some delay on the bio 
plastics in Sichuan because of the 2 reasons: one is the facility mostly
 the equipments, there may be some modification or adjustments to better
 suit it for its purpose. And also, we may -- we're also looking at -- a
 possibly better location within Sichuan -- within the same city but a 
better location for our project.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. How quickly can you bring this project on 
because at our last conference call, which is, I think, 2 months ago, 
you were guiding for that to be completed by the end of the year. So are
 you saying that you can bring on 300,000 metric tons of capacity, in 
like, less than a year? Is that possible, you don't even have the 
location? Or is this going to be a phased rollout of capacity like we 
saw in the first phase of Sichuan where you had 200,000 metric tons and 
216,000 and then 300,000?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. So Jason, basically just want to make sure I 
understand your question correctly and also convey that to the 
management correctly. It's basically, first of all, what's the time 
frame, given the new situation? Secondly, how we are going to roll out 
the project, either it's phased or it's like [shot].</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Correct.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Jason, so give you more details on the progress on
 the biodegradable project. So what happened to the original location is
 we have found -- after the survey, we have found that there's some 
underground water, which will not only increase the cost but also time 
consuming for us to undertake on the original sites. That's why we are 
embedded in other sites. The government is very supportive, and I think 
we will accomplish that. And secondly, with respect to the agreements. 
Basically, the -- it's centered around PRA production line because this 
biodegradable and material, there are some new equipments and technology
 available, we want to take advantage of that. So however, the 
production line facility designing has been coming to very close to the 
final phase. So all in, we are currently looking at probably, the 
project will be put off for a year. However, it will be phased. We're 
going to roll out our capacity in a staged manner.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. So are you telling me that it is put off for a 
year and the capacity is rolled out in a staged manner? It might see the
 full capacity out of Sichuan by the end of 2019.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Correct.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. Similarly, can we get some guidance from Harbin 
with respect to the biodegradable plastics and the cloud computing 
facility? Is that still on target for July 2019?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Let me also double check with the management. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So Jason, for Harbin, the designing phase and also the 
project scope are very similar to that of Sichuan. So we'll also utilize
 the new equipment designs. So -- and in addition, the construction in 
Harbin, because of the severe poor weather in winter, possibly, will be a
 little bit later than Sichuan. But we think about the same time, maybe 
delayed by a few months, the completion time for Harbin than Sichuan.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. And out of the biodegradable facility, are we still expecting gross margin in the high 20s?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes, Jason. We expect to be above 20% gross margin for biodegradable with the past.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. I guess, my next question is with respect to the
 new international customer that we might see you guys link up with -- 
the press release mentioned several top global customers in the 
Automotive sector. So I was wondering if you could provide any 
additional guidance about when you might proceed with sales to these new
 customers and progress that you've made in developing them.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So Jason, with the global customer, for example, with 
our model we have started supplying to them in China already. As for -- 
so to them -- are we still supplying to them globally? We think probably
 it will take some time, most likely by the end of this year or the next
 year, the latest.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: So you'll be able to utilize the capacity, will that be coming from Dubai for the international sales?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So for -- it's basically going to be if we are supplying
 to their -- to them in China, will be from our Sichuan facility. If 
from overseas, most likely going to be from Dubai.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. With respect to the current business, how much 
of your plastic production, as a percent of sales, is nonautomotive?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So in this year or for International?</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Yes. Do you have any or was the South Korean customer 
the -- so nonautomotive sales and do you -- plus you've, I believe, 
stopped providing them plastic products?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: I mean, for the Korean customer...</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: (inaudible) Yes.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: (foreign language) Okay. Jason, so for the Korean 
customer, the -- because the material, the product we sold to them are 
mostly for Automotive and also some Electronics. So sometimes, we can 
probably look at it from a -- we can get a sense but it's not going to 
be possible to say, like at least 100% accuracy. So with that, we think 
that possibly 80% were in auto and the rest in other area.</p>
<p> JASON COOPER: Okay. And then, one quick question about another 
opportunity for you guys. So instead of having this non-binding 
go-private agreements, have you looked into potentially listing the CDR 
in China or in Hong Kong? It seems that they are trying to attract 
companies to list there, specifically in China, companies that are like 
yours with respect to high-tech manufacturing companies, environmentally
 friendly companies. It seems like listing via CDR potentially could 
generate shareholder value, not only for the buyer consortium but also 
for the minority shareholders.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Jason, not yet. We're not looking at those options yet.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (foreign language)</p>
<p> Our next question comes from the line of [Owen Levi,] Wells Fargo.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Taylor, the $900,000 professional fee, is that
 the final payment to Duff &amp; Phelps, for their independent valuation
 that we hired them in yield area to perform?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: The $900 (sic) [$900,000] includes other professional 
fees, such as legal, accounting and it does not include the final 
payments to Duff &amp; Phelps.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Has Duff &amp; Phelps completed their independent valuation?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Now let me check with the management in China. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: [Owen], so as for the going-private transaction, 
Chairman Han presented some comments. So first of all, the bank 
consortium is first the special committee to speed up their process. So,
 so far, we understand, first of all, especially maybe on behalf of the 
minority shareholder has taken a very detailed approach in terms of the 
terms and structure of the proposal to get the best offer for the 
minority shareholders. Secondly, the bank consortium also undertaking 
possible financing so there are some change of structure in order to 
lower the cost, so which also cost some time over there. And lastly, he 
wants to say that the bank consortium is committed to the nonbanking 
offer that we issued over the last year.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. Well, listen, you guys had a great 
quarter. I'd be a lot more excited about it if the company traded on 
fundamentals and it hasn't. So 15 months of this nonbinding proposal. 
And so I would remind that the special committee that as a public U.S. 
company, the board has a fiduciary obligation to maximize shareholder 
value for all shareholders, not just the insiders that are going to 
participate and think about it. The current point of action has the 
stock price now to come -- it's trading below $4 a share. And so I would
 ask, as a shareholder that's bearing the expense of Duff &amp; Phelps 
and Davis Polk that the Special Committee has hired, we are their 
clients. (inaudible) deadline, finish the valuation, make that 
information public, file it as an 8-K. That will validate how insanely 
undervalued the stock price currently is; cancel the nonbinding 
proposal, which is unfair. It hasn't been -- or make a revised offer 
that is fair. That offer was over a year ago. The stock has performed 
quite well since then. You can't honestly come back to the same thought 
coming on the share. We'd love to hear from the Special Committee. I 
think silence breeds speculation. Clearly, it hasn't helped the stock 
price. Not only because it's the right thing to do, because they have a 
fiduciary obligation to tell us what their intent is for this company. 
Talk to us, tell your shareholders what you are doing. There are 
independent directors on the Board. We've been trusting you with our 
capital and there are real consequences for the stock price going down 
the way it has. So if you can at least share those comments to the 
Special Committee, they essentially control their stock price sales. 
Their earnings don't matter. Frankly, I find it silly we're spending as 
much time talking about the numbers at this -- your share price is 
completely held hostage by this nonbinding proposal.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Let me translate.(foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: [Owen], lastly, Chairman Han mentioned that first, the 
bank consortium has done their best and we'll continue doing so in the 
future. Right now, their focus is getting financing for the transaction.
 And hopefully, they'll be the best for everybody.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) (foreign language) Our next question comes from Glenn Krevlin from Glenhill.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN, MANAGING MEMBER &amp; PRESIDENT, GLENHILL 
CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC: I have 3 questions. One, what's the projected 
capital spending now for this year in light of some of the comments that
 you've made? Second, what's your plan on refinancing the short-term 
debt? And third, in the press release, there is a reference that 
overseas sales were about $55 million. Can you give us some context? Was
 this customers besides the Korean customer that you've had table issues
 with or was this the same customer that you're now doing business with,
 and where is this material being sourced from for overseas before Dubai
 is opened?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Glenn, thank you for the question. So first of all, for 
the CapEx of [Dubai] first. So for this year, the total CapEx of 2018 is
 expected to be possibly $409 million, mostly for our Sichuan, Dubai and
 also Heilongjiang production business. For the oversea customer, it is 
the same South Korean customer. We have a overdue situation. However, 
given same situation in the past, we do believe we'll be able to collect
 the overdue balance in the very near -- in the next few months. And in 
addition, we have made some progress with some other global customer. 
Although, current still sales in China, but we anticipate sales will 
materialize for them by the end of this year or next year. And for your 
second question, on the financing, let me turn to the management and get
 an answer for it. (foreign language)</p>
<p> JIE HAN: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Glenn, for refinancing, obviously, we have been -- it's 
our goal to lower the balance over short term and increase our long-term
 debt to fund several projects we are undertaking, and we have been 
working on that. And I think, give us some time, we'll be able to change
 our capital structure and make sure the debt structure will be -- 
assemble our project time frame.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: Taylor, I was a little bit confused in terms 
of your comments on the Korean customer. The best of my knowledge, in 
the last financial statement, you indicated you were -- they had owed 
you money, yet you continued to do business with them in the quarter. 
That's where I'm confused.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So again, what happened is because the overdue situation
 is according to our -- extend their terms with our customer with such 
an overdue. We actually suspended additional sales to them, given the 
first quarter of 2018. So in other words, we'll not supply to them any 
products until they bring their balance overdue situation back.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: So we should expect that sales from overseas 
customers in this current quarter will be substantially less than $55 
million?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: You mean, for the second quarter?</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: Yes.</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Let me check with our -- my Dubai colleague. (foreign language)</p>
<p> KENAN GONG: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> KENAN GONG: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: So Glenn, we have been working with the customer to 
adopt the issue and we have got a commitment from them. We expect that 
they will bring their balance currents by the end of second quarter, and
 we will resume business with them under very close monitoring.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: So there'll be little sales in the second 
quarter, but you hope to resume in the third quarter. Is that what I'm 
understanding in overseas sales?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: And are you going to limit your sales to this
 customer, Taylor, since they've continued to be overdue several times? 
Are you going to put limits on the amount of sales because it seems to 
be a problem that's happened at least once or twice before?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> KENAN GONG: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes, Glenn. Definitely. As Chairman Han mentioned 
previously that on one hand, we care our customers but on the other 
hand, we also want to make sure that for this particular case, we have 
added additional terms and also restrictions and those terms are being 
discussed. Obviously, the goal is to make sure that this situation or 
scenario will not happen again in the future.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: Right. And then, Taylor, can you -- last 
question, can you give us some sense, since you have Dubai coming online
 and its higher end product, how much of that capacity do you have 
spoken for in terms of potential customers, as you phase that in? I 
think, you said at the end of June and then throughout the year. How do 
we stand with customer potential there?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. Let me ask. (foreign language)</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes, Glenn. We have -- we are currently testing products
 with potential customer in Germany and also in Czech Republic.</p>
<p> GLENN JEFFREY KREVLIN: So you're confident that, that capacity will get utilized in -- as it comes on stream?</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Okay. (foreign language)</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (foreign language)</p>
<p> ZHANG DAHE: Yes. Correct, Glenn.</p>
<p> ANNA BIN: On behalf of China XD Plastics, we want to thank you for 
your interest and your participation in this call. If you would like to 
speak with us further, please call either myself or Taylor in XD's New 
York office. The contact numbers for all of us are listed at the end of 
the press release.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the 
conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may all
 disconnect.</p>

<p> I'll now turn the call over to Brad to discuss Archrock's first quarter results.</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ARCHROCK, INC.: 
Thank you, Paul. I'm excited to share that 2018 is off to a great start.
 Archrock achieved strong operating performance in the first quarter on 
both revenue and profitability, and we increased the operating 
horsepower and achieved a record backlog of contract and professional 
orders. The strong market outlook continues to support high levels of 
new bookings and forecasted increases in U.S. natural gas production 
will serve as a foundation for continued expansion beyond 2018.</p>
<p> Let me share some highlights. In the first quarter, our contract 
operations revenue increased by 3% sequentially to $161 million, with 
strong contract operations gross margin. For the fourth consecutive 
quarter, we increased operating horsepower, adding 60,000 in the 
quarter. We continue to book new orders at record levels and at improved
 pricing, positioning us well into 2019.</p>
<p> We closed the merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners, further 
strengthening our financial platform to propel our next leg of growth. 
And we started the deleveraging process, ending the quarter with a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.0x pro forma for the merger.</p>
<p> Now turning to our operations. Our sales team continues to convert 
customer demand into profitable contract operations bookings, with the 
strongest demand from the Permian and the SCOOP/STACK, Niobrara and the 
Eagle Ford. As a result of this strong demand and excellent customer 
service, our sales team again secured contract operations bookings at 
historically high levels and at pricing levels that were higher than in 
the previous quarter. Of the strong 3% sequential increase in contract 
operations revenue, roughly half is attributable to higher operating 
horsepower, and the other half is attributable to rate increases on the 
operating fleet. We implemented a price increase on the eligible portion
 of the operating fleet in the first quarter, and we expect to realize 
additional price increases on our operating fleet throughout 2018.</p>
<p> In the field, our operations teams continue to cost-effectively 
deliver industry-leading safety performance and equipment runtimes to 
our customers, and we posted strong gross margin performance despite 
weather-related operational challenges early in the quarter. Our team 
remains laser-focused on quickly and economically starting new units for
 customers so we can convert our sizable backlog into revenues.</p>
<p> The aftermarket service segment had a solid quarter during what is 
typically a seasonally slower quarter. This segment is expanding its 
customers' catch-up on deferred maintenance. With strong demand for our 
aftermarket products and services, we started implementing price 
increases during the first quarter.</p>
<p> Now I'd like to turn to the market and outlook for our businesses. A
 robust natural gas production forecast serves as the foundation for 
Archrock's growth. The compression business is highly correlated to 
natural gas production, and the EIA is forecasting that U.S. natural gas
 production will be 7.5 Bcf a day higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, 
with additional growth throughout at least 2022.</p>
<p> The United States have significant amounts of affordable and 
accessible natural gas due to the technologies that have unlocked the 
abundant reserves in our shale plays in both dry gas as well as 
associated gas in more oil and liquids prone plays, such as in the 
Permian and SCOOP/STACK. This abundance of natural gas is expected to 
keep natural gas prices range-bound and stable for the next decade, and 
we believe it will continue to support increasing use of natural gas for
 power and as a feedstock for petrochemical use.</p>
<p> In power, we see increasing demand in LNG, U.S. power plants and 
exports to Mexico, with LNG being the largest driver of this demand. By 
the end of 2022, analysts anticipate that the U.S. will have 5 
operational terminals, averaging 8 Bcf a day of LNG exports.</p>
<p> In sum, the strong supply and demand fundamentals for natural gas 
production makes this an exciting time to be in the compression 
business.</p>
<p> The increasing demand for our services is demonstrated by our 
contract operations utilization, which ended the first quarter at 86%, 
an increase of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. On units greater than
 1,000-horsepower per unit, our utilization was 89% at the end of the 
first quarter as compared to 87% at the end of the fourth quarter. And 
on all 3-stage units, which are typically the best technical solution 
for most current growth plays, our utilization was at 91% at the end of 
the first quarter. While the market for large horsepower tightens, we're
 also experiencing a recovery in the small horsepower market due to 
increased completion rates driving single well Gas Lift opportunities. 
As a result, our utilization for units under 1,000 horsepower ended the 
first quarter at 80%, a 2% improvement over a year ago.</p>
<p> Based on the U.S. natural gas production forecast and our customers'
 expanding production plans, we're revising our full year growth CapEx 
guidance upward by $30 million to a range of $230 million to $250 
million for 2018. The $30 million incremental increase in growth CapEx 
from our prior guidance will be used to meet customer demand in growth 
plays with large horsepower units. We expect to fund the additional 
CapEx with internal funding sources, and we expect our net cash consumed
 by the increase in growth CapEx to be negligible as we're targeting 
proceeds of $30 million from the disposal of assets in 2018, $15 million
 of which occurred in the first quarter.</p>
<p> Now let me turn to our financial strategy. Our current financial 
strategy has 3 priorities. The first one I want to highlight is our 
priority to capture the organic growth opportunities generated by the 
market and to do so with internal funding sources. During this period of
 rapid market expansion, we're working to balance an abundant and 
attractive opportunity set with investors' demands for capital 
discipline and return of capital. We're selecting investments that 
provide attractive returns and that will fulfill market demand in the 
long term with enhanced shareholder value.</p>
<p> The second priority I want to discuss is our objective to reduce 
leverage. Our goal is to reduce leverage to below 4x debt to EBITDA, and
 we're targeting reaching this goal in 2020. In the first quarter, our 
trailing 4-quarter EBITDA increased for the first time since the market 
began its recovery. The inflection point reached in the first quarter is
 an important step to allow for organic deleveraging, and we ended the 
quarter with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio 5.0x pro forma for the merger. As 
we roll in future quarters of improving EBITDA, we expect to continue to
 deliver.</p>
<p> Finally, we're committed to returning capital to our investors. 
Having closed the merger early in the second quarter, we intend to 
recommend to the Archrock Board of Directors a 10% increase in the 
annual dividend rate, beginning with the second quarter dividend. This 
is an acceleration of our initial plan, which was to recommend an 
increase in the first full quarter following the merger closing that 
would have been in the third quarter. Thereafter, we're targeting a 10% 
to 15% annual increase in the dividend through 2020.</p>
<p> This brings me to the merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners, 
which closed in April. The merger clearly supports our long-term 
strategy and financial objectives, and Archrock's shareholders and 
Archrock Partners' unitholders strongly supported the transaction. Our 
simplified structure strengthens our financial profile and enhances our 
ability to execute on our strategic growth plans. It accelerates our 
deleveraging and allows us to invest additional retained cash flow into 
the business to take advantage of the robust market we're currently 
seeing. In addition, the transaction broadens our access to capital and 
reduces our cost of capital.</p>
<p> The long-term outlook for Archrock is robust. Our strategy is to 
provide exceptional service to our customers with high-quality 
compression assets in growing natural gas producing basins across the 
United States. Our focus in 2018 will be in putting our sizable backlog 
to work, operating efficiently and capturing profitable new 
opportunities with customers. We will also continue to invest in our 
fleets, our processes, technology and our great employees. I'm confident
 we can meet increased demand from our customers and drive returns for 
our stockholders.</p>
<p> Now I would like to turn the call over to Randy for a review of our financial results.</p>
<p> RAYMOND K. GUBA, INTERIM CFO, ARCHROCK, INC.: Thanks, Brad. Let's 
look at a summary of first quarter 2018 results and then cover guidance 
for the second quarter of 2018. Archrock delivered solid first quarter 
results. We generated EBITDA as adjusted of $79 million for the first 
quarter compared to $72 million in the fourth quarter. Revenues were 
$212 million for the first quarter, up about 1% compared to fourth 
quarter levels as we increased revenue in our contract operations 
business.</p>
<p> Turning to our segments. In contract operations, revenue came in 
strong at $161 million in the first quarter, up 3% from $156 million in 
the fourth quarter due to higher operating horsepower and rate 
increases. Gross margin percentage in the first quarter increased to 60%
 from 59% in the fourth quarter. Our expense per horsepower ticked down 
1.8% in the quarter.</p>
<p> Improvement in our contract operations margin in the quarter is 
attributable to U.S. GAAP revenue recognition changes that we 
implemented on January 1, 2018, as required. Prior to its adoption, 
revenue and expenses related to mobilization and freight on our units 
was recognized as incurred. Starting January 1, 2018, this segment is 
recognizing these items over the average contract term.</p>
<p> In aftermarket services, revenues of $51 million for the first 
quarter are down 3% sequentially from $53 million in the fourth quarter.
 This is primarily due to the first quarter being a typically seasonally
 slower quarter. Gross margin percentage was up 50 basis points 
sequentially. As the energy market expansion unfolds, we will be working
 to drive gross margin percentage higher in this business.</p>
<p> Similar to contract operations, our aftermarket services segment was
 also affected by the U.S. GAAP revenue recognition changes implemented 
in the beginning of the year. Prior to its adoption, revenue and 
expenses for our aftermarket services segment was recognized when 
completed. Starting January 1, this segment is recognizing revenue and 
expense over time.</p>
<p> SG&amp;A expenses were $28 million in the first quarter, down 7% 
compared to fourth quarter 2017 levels. First quarter SG&amp;A benefited
 from lower compensation and benefit costs as well as lower bad debt 
expenses.</p>
<p> During the first quarter, we determined that approximately 45 idle 
compressor units, totaling approximately 22,000 horsepower, would be 
retired from active fleet. As a result of the retirement of these units,
 we recorded a $5 million asset impairment charge.</p>
<p> In the first quarter, Archrock's growth capital expenditures were 
$54 million, in line with the fourth quarter, as we continued to invest 
in new equipment to meet strong customer demand. Maintenance CapEx for 
the quarter was $11 million, similar to fourth quarter levels.</p>
<p> First quarter ending debt on a consolidated basis was $1.4 billion, 
up $10 million from the fourth quarter levels. First quarter 
consolidated cash was $4 million. The increase in consolidated debt in 
Q1 is primarily due to continued investment in our fleet. We started the
 deleveraging process in the first quarter, reducing our leverage to 
5.0x on a pro forma basis for the merger. Our available but undrawn 
capacity on our revolving credit facility was $282 million on a pro 
forma basis for the merger.</p>
<p> Archrock's first quarter dividend was $0.12 per share, unchanged 
from the fourth quarter. The first quarter dividend amount of $16 
million will be paid on May 15 to all shareholders of record on May 8, 
which will include all of the Archrock shares issued as part of the 
Archrock merger with Archrock Partners that closed in April. Archrock 
cash available for dividend coverage was a strong 2.9x for the first 
quarter.</p>
<p> Now before we move to guidance, I'd like to take a moment to discuss
 a change we will be making to our EBITDA as adjusted calculation. 
Beginning for results of the second quarter of 2018, we will exclude 
noncash equity compensation from our EBITDA as adjusted calculation. 
Excluding this expense from the first quarter 2018 results would have 
resulted in approximately $2 million additional EBITDA as adjusted. 
Excluding this expense from 2017 results would have resulted in an 
approximately $8 million additional EBITDA as adjusted. This change 
would put us more in line with our peers from a comparable reporting 
perspective. However, it should be noted that the change will not affect
 our credit facility leverage as this expense is already excluded from 
the calculation.</p>
<p> Now let's discuss Archrock's guidance for the second quarter of 
2018. In contract operations, we expect revenue of $162 million to $166 
million as we continue to benefit from increasing operating horsepower 
as well as a price increase we implemented at the beginning of 2018. We 
expect gross margins in the 59% to 61% range. For AMS, we expect revenue
 of $48 million to $52 million, with gross margin between 15% and 17%.</p>
<p> On SG&amp;A expenses, we expect $28 million to $29 million for the 
second quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be 
in the mid-$40 million range, with interest expense in the low $20 
million range.</p>
<p> For full year 2018, we expect total CapEx of $300 million to $320 
million. As Brad mentioned, this is an increase of $30 million for 
additional newbuild capital to support the strong market we're 
experiencing. Maintenance capital spending for 2018 is expected to be 
$40 million to $45 million consisting -- consistent with our prior 
guidance. Newbuild capital expenditures are expected to be $230 million 
to $250 million for the full year of 2018 as we continue to invest in 
our high-demand, large-horsepower units. As Brad mentioned, this is an 
increase of $30 million but is expected to have a negligible effect on 
our net cash position due to targeted asset sales of $30 million.</p>
<p> I will now turn the call back to the operator and open it up for questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Blake Hutchinson from Scotia Howard Wheel.</p>
<p> BLAKE ALLEN HUTCHINSON, OIL SERVICES ANALYST, SCOTIA HOWARD WEIL, 
RESEARCH DIVISION: Brad, I guess, kind of following on the discussion of
 the opportunity sets that's out there, requiring a bit of an aggressive
 capital spend and balancing that with your goals of leverage reduction.
 Can you just talk in terms of giving us comfort on these capital 
outlays. The typical initial terms you're seeing in terms of length of 
contract for the equipment you're currently adding? And has that 
increased with the bookings increasing? And also maybe speak to the 
typical life span of initial contract in the field, just to give us an 
idea of what the cash flow stream or the more secure portion of the cash
 flow stream, I guess, would look like for some of these units going out
 there.</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Sure. So you -- just a couple of thoughts on it
 in the answer to the question. The utilization that we're seeing the 
fleet right now and in the marketplace, the point I wanted to make sure 
it was clear, is that 3-stage units, which are the units that are in 
demand right now, are at 91% utilization in our fleet. I've discussed in
 the past, 90% to 91% utilization in a category like that is the highest
 we've experienced as a company, full stop. Which means that the market,
 and I think everybody is experiencing this, needs equipment. So that's a
 starting position.</p>
<p> Second issue for us is that we did make the decision in the quarter 
and executed in the quarter to exit 1 market that was not strategic to 
us, that's California, which generated some CapEx -- generated some cash
 inflows. We also had some purchases by customers, sometimes through 
repurchase option and otherwise just through discussions with customers,
 that we think are aggregating some CapEx. And so as we saw this in the 
quarter and we saw that happening in the business, our plan is to 
redeploy that cash per units. So the comment I made that we expect this 
to have a negligible impact on our net cash position for the year is one
 we meant for those reasons.</p>
<p> Now to go to the question you asked also, the terms have definitely 
expanded on large horsepower. We're typically seeing terms that are in 
the 3- to 4-year category for large horsepower, and the rates are 
excellent. Now what I'll point out also, though, is that beyond the 
primary term, these units typically, especially large horsepower, tend 
to stay out substantially longer beyond the initial term and get renewed
 at very high rates. So we're very comfortable. We like the investment 
opportunities that we're seeing right now, which I know the market is 
trying to understand. But with the amount of gas that is being produced 
and expected to be produced, we see this as great long-term growth 
opportunities, generating great returns for our investors.</p>
<p> BLAKE ALLEN HUTCHINSON: And then, I guess, on the flip side, the 
cost structure or at least the implied cost per horsepower that we're 
looking at for the quarter, quite a step down from kind of averages of 
last year for a quarter that we usually think about being kind of rich 
with mobilizations. I mean, is there something new in terms of less 
friction in the business, more seamless process in terms of putting 
equipment to work? Or are you just trying to -- getting some advantages 
of scale as you add to the fleet here?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Well, it's two things. One thing I'd out is 
that our level of start mobilization and make-ready activity remain at 
elevated levels and at levels comparable Q4 to Q1. The biggest impact to
 the quarterly performance is what Randy described, and that is that we 
were require to adopt an accounting policy change that is going to 
differ and amortize into future periods more of that installation, 
mobilization and transportation cost. And so the quarter had a pickup 
due in large part to that accounting convention that we're required to 
adopt. I think that's the biggest impact you're seeing for the quarter. 
The one thing that I want to emphasize is that on top of that, we had a 
very good operational quarter, especially in the face of extreme -- we 
had some extreme weather challenges early in the quarter, we continue to
 have make-ready expenses at elevated rates, which impact both our CapEx
 and our OpEx. And it's a tough labor market out there, so we still are 
contending with wage and compensation expense challenges as is everybody
 in order to do the right job in bringing in the talent and retaining 
the talent required to grow at the aggressive gross -- growth rates of 
the market. So wanting us to support right now.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Andrew Burd from JPMorgan.</p>
<p> ANDREW RAMSAY BURD, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: So my first question is in the context of the recently 
completed merger with AROC, and now you're probably better classified as
 an operating company versus a holding company previously. So the 
question is, in your opinion, is AROC a midstream company or an oil 
field services company? And based on that answer, how are you viewing 
financial priorities based on your perceived investor base? For example,
 if you're catering to midstream investors, are you focused on 
distributable cash flow and dividends versus maybe oilfield services 
investors, who are less familiar with seeing free cash flow yield and 
leverage where they are? So any color on how your thoughts may have 
changed given the new structure?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Yes, totally fair question. As we're looking to
 the future of Archrock as an operating company, we note that the 
operations and assets that we continue to operate have not changed 
substantially. Rather than the envelope, we are going to be focusing 
with our investors and targeting the right investor market in the 
operations that we have. We note that 60% to 80% of our business is gas 
gathering either at the wellhead or in some sort of gathering stations, 
which is very much a midstream operation. The other 20-plus percent, 
approximately 23% to 24% currently, is Gas Lift, which is directly tied 
to production and critically not to drilling and completion activities. 
Our contract terms are longer than typical oil and gas service 
businesses. And the capital investment that we -- and the capital that 
we deploy is typically longer life. So what we see is that we primarily 
are right now a C corp that has very good cash flow generating -- stable
 through the cycle cash flow generating assets. It's probably more 
comparable to the midstream space than it is the oil and gas servicing 
space. So that's the way we're going to be talking to our investors and 
thinking about how our investors want to see return of capital and 
growth balanced from us going forward.</p>
<p> ANDREW RAMSAY BURD: No, that's a great answer. And housekeeping 
question. On the revenue guidance for next quarter, quite a modest 
uplift it would seem, given the capital deployed in the first quarter 
and rising utilization and pricing trends. Is there any asset sale 
factored into that revenue guidance or not?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: It's not material. There are no material asset sales factored into that.</p>
<p> ANDREW RAMSAY BURD: Okay. And then on the asset sales, if you could 
just expand on -- because, obviously, it's been a larger number over the
 last 2 quarters, and you -- it sounds like you have a little bit of 
visibility on some continued asset sales over the course of the year. 
Can you -- if there are kind of chunky portions of that asset sale 
bucket, can you just kind of talk to what those assets look like? Are 
they utilized? Are they unutilized? Are they in a particular region? 
Maybe an anecdote or two would be helpful as we kind of frame what's 
leaving the fleet.</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Yes, so let me talk first about first -- fourth
 quarter '17 and then I'll talk about first quarter '18, and then an 
idea of what our expectations are for this activity going forward. In 
the fourth quarter of '17, we had a pretty substantial transaction where
 we sold equipment that we had previously already culled out of our 
feet. So not only was it not operating horsepower, it was no longer a 
part of the fleet that we were seeking to redeploy. And so we -- it had 1
 large -- 1 relatively large transaction for horsepower that we no 
longer wanted to invest in, try to operate or try to put back to work, 
and we sold back into the used equipment market in one sizable 
transaction. This is an important priority for us. We're focused on 
continuing to standardize and improve the competitiveness of our fleet 
longer term, and we've seen the process of addressing some of this more 
experienced, veteran -- these veteran units in our fleet as an important
 part of that process, as important as what we invest in. So that was 
all idle, nonoperated and, actually, not even in the fleet.</p>
<p> In Q1, we had 1 substantial transaction, the biggest part of the 
cell, was we exited our California contract operations business. It's a 
nongrowth market. It's not a strategic market. We had a small amount of 
horsepower in that market. Its' equipment that would not move around 
well. We didn't want to pull it out and move it to another market, and 
the customer was very amenable to taking over the operation of that 
equipment. So those are 2 examples, the 2 anecdotes as requested. And 
again, I think that it's important to note that this reflects our 
continuing focus on improving the quality and competitiveness of our 
fleet as well as it generates some cash that we can redeploy. On a 
go-forward basis, right now, I candidly don't see sizable transactions 
available to us in 2018. What we will continue to do, however, is need 
to meet purchase option exercises where customers have those. That's a 
very small portion of the fleet typically. And we will also continue to 
try to sell and monetize assets that we no longer want to use or compete
 with. But it should be smaller numbers compared to the last -- compared
 to Q4 and Q1.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from John Watson from Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
<p> JOHN H. WATSON, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, SIMMONS &amp; 
COMPANY INTERNATIONAL, RESEARCH DIVISION: Brad, I apologize if I missed 
this, but with the increased CapEx -- the increased growth CapEx budget 
for 2018, is there an update on how much horsepower you expect to build 
for the year? I think previously, the number was 250,000 horsepower, but
 correct me if I'm mistaken.</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Yes, that number is a little low. I think that,
 that would relate to a spend rate of a couple of hundred million, would
 be 250,000. What I can tell you -- what, actually, I'd share with you 
is that based on both what we spent in '17 and what we're spending in 
'18, we expect deliveries of about 330,000 horsepower in 2018. And 
another thing that's really important is that about 85% of that is 
committed to customers. So this -- the horsepower that we're bringing in
 has just a huge backlog of commits to support the level of spend we're 
engaging in.</p>
<p> JOHN H. WATSON: Very helpful. The release talks about your record 
contract ops backlog, which is exciting to hear. Can you break down for 
us the portion of that you expect to be filled by some of this new 
horsepower you're ordering versus units that are currently in the fleet?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Yes, the way we look at that, about, and I 
think I've said this in the past, but we expect about 60% of our starts 
in '18 to come out of existing fleet assets and 40% to be -- to apply to
 new horsepower.</p>
<p> JOHN H. WATSON: And do you expect that to be consistent in '19 since
 you're expecting part of that backlog to go well into next year?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: No, I expect that the portion of -- if the 
market continues at its current pace, this very rapid and aggressive 
growth we're experiencing, we are not going to have the same level of 
idle fleet capacity to meet that same ratio. So we believe that as we 
get -- as utilization continues to tick up, that this level of growth 
would require more newbuild horsepower in the future. But I also note 
that what we -- we haven't really seen what customers are going to 
demand fully for '19, and so it's a little too early to fully bake what 
'19 is going to look like yet.</p>
<p> JOHN H. WATSON: Sure. But I appreciate the color nonetheless. On 
pricing, you talked about pricing being higher than in previous 
quarters. On the Q4 call, we talked about spot pricing improving by 
roughly 20% year-over-year. Is it safe to assume that pricings moved 
higher than that range you quoted on last quarter's call? Or am I 
thinking about that the wrong way?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: The easy answer is yes. Spot pricing is yet 
higher. It was higher in the first quarter and currently than it was 
when I made that comment in respect to the fourth quarter. The 
correction or kind of a clarification I want to offer you is that, that 
really relates to the large horsepower that we're putting out, the 
greater-than-1000-horsepower units that are going out. It's not an 
across-the-board 20%. In smaller and midrange horsepower, the pricing 
differential compared to large is smaller.</p>
<p> JOHN H. WATSON: Right. Great. And one last one for me. Could you 
quantify what percentage of your idle fleets are 3-stage units?</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: I don't have that off the top of my head. I'll 
share with you, it's -- the vast bulk of the fleet is 3-stage. But with 
apologies, John, I just don't have that. I don't have that handy.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Brad for final remarks.</p>
<p> D. BRADLEY CHILDERS: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, 
for participating in our first quarter call this morning. I'd reiterate,
 the market outlook for our business continues to remain very robust. 
And we look forward to describing our performance for the second quarter
 in our next quarterly call. Thank you very much.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's 
conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now 
disconnect.</p>

Adam?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS, CEO, RE/MAX HOLDINGS, INC.: Thank you, Andy, and 
thanks to everyone for joining our call today. RE/MAX was created 45 
years ago last month based on a simple premise, create an environment 
where productive agents could come together, motivate each other and see
 their results soar. Some in the industry claim we started a revolution.
 The concept seems so logical, a truly entrepreneurial agent-centric 
model. But it was groundbreaking at the time. Almost half a century 
later, that original business model is still going strong. All around 
the globe, over 119,000 RE/MAX agents in more than 100 countries and 
territories are delivering great outcomes to buyers and sellers.</p>
<p> Now the rest of the real estate industry seems to be trying to catch
 up. Many competitors are now also focused on being agent-centric. And 
although, 2018 has been described as the year of the agent, our 
commitment to the best agents in real estate has been our focus since 
day one. This is what has made us so successful. We are #1 in the world.
 Nobody in the world sells more real estate than RE/MAX based on 
residential transaction size. Our network, our business model and our 
foundation have never been stronger, and I'm excited about the prospects
 for continuing our momentum.</p>
<p> Next week, I'm headed to our R4 annual conference where agents and 
brokers gather to exchanged their ideas and discuss the latest 
developments in real estate. We will have robust attendance this year. 
Yet another sign that RE/MAX brand continues to strengthen every day. I 
could not be more excited to go to R4 this year.</p>
<p> We have a brand people know. A growing global presence, a collection
 of unique competitive advantages and, most importantly, the most 
dynamic agents and brokers in the business.</p>
<p> The path we are forging today grows from the transformative insights
 that Dave and Gail Liniger brought to the marketplace and the hard work
 of all those who have contributed to making RE/MAX the most successful 
and respected brand in the business.</p>
<p> Turning to Slide 4. During the past year, we continued to see the 
strengths of our business model, as we executed on our strategy and grew
 our business, delivering strong results in the process. We achieved 
success in 2017 by advancing the 3 core pillars that create shareholder 
value; organic growth, acquisition and investment catalysts and return 
of capital to shareholders.</p>
<p> In order to drive organic growth last year, we focused on helping 
our RE/MAX franchisees recruit and retain quality agents and continued 
to emphasize franchise sales.</p>
<p> Expanding the Motto brand and helping those new franchisees get up and running also contributed to our organic growth.</p>
<p> For the full year 2017, we added over 7,000 agents worldwide, a 6.4%
 increase year-over-year as we surpassed 119,000 agents globally. RE/MAX
 global franchise sales had its best year in more than a decade with 
over 1,000 units sold.</p>
<p> Motto Mortgage franchise sales finished the year strong. In just 16 
months since we launched, we've now sold over 70 franchisees and 
currently have more than 30 Motto Mortgage franchises opened and 
operating. Our focus on organic growth fueled our stable recurring 
revenue streams. This, coupled with our disciplined approach to expense 
management, produced healthy margins and generated $61 million in free 
cash flow.</p>
<p> Our investment catalysts drove further growth in 2017 and will 
continue to help generate attractive shareholder returns going forward. 
We continue to be committed to reinvesting in the top priorities of our 
business. Innovation, training and technology.</p>
<p> We created a new business and product strategy team focused on 
innovation, corporate strategy and product development, led by Executive
 Vice President Pete Crowe. Today's highly competitive real estate 
landscape makes it essential to find new ways to help brokers and agents
 serve buyers and sellers.</p>
<p> Pete's team will help us continue to evolve and stay one step ahead of the competition.</p>
<p> As a franchisor one of our key success factors is the world class training we provide to our network.</p>
<p> Our focus on assisting our entrepreneurial franchisees to recruit 
and retain high quality agents has always been foundational to our value
 proposition. Our commitment to our network was evident by the 44-city 
Profit/Ability tour throughout North America earlier this year. In each 
location RE/MAX executives met with local franchisees to discuss 
critical strategies to help them grow their operations and build 
thriving businesses. The Profit/Ability tour was free for RE/MAX 
franchisees. We have leveraged face-to-face trainings like the 
Profit/Ability tour throughout our history as we are passionate about 
our ability to deliver value and maintain positive business 
relationships with the best broker/owners in the industry. Helping our 
offices lead for profitability is important. Greater office revenue 
drives enhanced services and benefits for our agents.</p>
<p> In turn, those agents are able to deliver even better service to 
home buyers and sellers. It's a virtuous cycle that benefits everyone.</p>
<p> On the technology front, we continued to make substantial 
investments in the past year, including launching new social media and 
digital marketing solutions for agents. RE/MAX, the #1 name in real 
estate, once again has the most visited real estate franchise website 
according to recent Hitwise data for 2017. The remax.com website drew 
over 90 million visits in 2017 according to internal data.</p>
<p> RE/MAX has a substantial digital footprint, and we continue to gain momentum and expand our reach.</p>
<p> Attracting more visits means more visibility for RE/MAX listings and
 more opportunities for RE/MAX agents to help buyers and sellers. We are
 committed to making the most productive network even more productive.</p>
<p> Another growth catalyst for our business is acquiring independent 
regions, which is a strategic priority for us. In November, we purchased
 the master franchise rights to the Northern Illinois region. Karri will
 have more on this acquisition later in the call.</p>
<p> In the last 2 years, we have acquired a 7 independent regions, representing more than 10,000 agents in almost 600 offices.</p>
<p> Our third pillar is return of capital. Our management team and our 
board are committed to returning capital to shareholders in a prudent 
and consistent manner.</p>
<p> We have paid a quarterly dividend since we went public over 4 years ago.</p>
<p> As a part of our commitment to return capital, we recommended, and 
the Board approved, an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend earlier 
this week.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 5.</p>
<p> One of the keys to being a successful franchisor is to have the #1 brand and market share.</p>
<p> RE/MAX has both. The #1 brand in real estate, and nobody in the 
world sells more real estate than RE/MAX as measured by residential 
transaction size.</p>
<p> The world's leading brands remain at the top because they share a common trait --</p>
<p> they evolve to stay ahead in changing markets and build upon hard-earned consumer loyalty.</p>
<p> World-renowned brands subtly refine their looks over time to fit 
consumer preferences and reinforce their culture, personality and 
competitive position.</p>
<p> Staying current lifts the value proposition at every level of an enterprise.</p>
<p> To provide our brokers and agents with even bigger marketing 
advantages with today's consumers, RE/MAX branding has been updated with
 a fresh modern design. This brand refresh looks great on yard signs and
 works well across social, digital, mobile and print platforms, further 
extending our brand strength, reach and strength. Consumer data and 
opinion drove this initiative. Over the past 2 years, more than 20,000 
consumers in the U.S. and Canada provided feedback on RE/MAX branding.</p>
<p> Our refresh brand is a deliberate move to continue to position 
RE/MAX agents as industry leaders for the home buyers and sellers of 
today and tomorrow.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 6. Motto Mortgage franchise sales accelerated 
through the fourth quarter, and we have now sold over 70 franchises in 
29 states since inception.</p>
<p> The vision and dedication of the Motto team has helped more than 20 
franchisees open their doors and effectively compete in their local 
market places.</p>
<p> Interest in owning a Motto franchises remains high. We are 
encouraged by the spreading interest in owning a franchise across 
different customer types, and we feel good about our pipeline.</p>
<p> We expect to sell tens of franchises in the forthcoming year. We are
 pleased with Motto's progress and the pace at which the brand continues
 to expand.</p>
<p> Turning to Slide 7. According to the February edition of the RE/MAX 
National Housing Report, which is based on MLS data from 53 Metro areas,
 the record speed of January home sales may signal that buyers aren't 
waiting for the typical Spring selling season to begin.</p>
<p> Despite the number of home sales being down 2.8% year-over-year, the
 February RE/MAX National Housing Report shows homes sold in only 60 
days on average last month, making the fewest days on market of any 
January in the 9-year history of the report.</p>
<p> The combination of robust demand and tight inventory resulted in 
higher sales prices. The median sales price of $224,000 also set a 
January record, up 6.7% year-over-year. Out of 53 markets, 51 posted 
gains, marking January as the 22nd consecutive month of year-over-year 
price increases dating back to April 2016.</p>
<p> Inventory remains constrained as the number of homes for sale in 
January 2018 was down 14.8% year-over-year. Based on the rate of home 
sales in January, the supply of inventory was 3.4 months compared to 3.8
 months in January 2017.</p>
<p> A 6-month supply generally indicates a market balanced equally between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p> Moving to Slide 8. We ended 2017 with over 119,000 agents in our 
global network. That's an increase of 6.4% compared to year-end 2016. 
Agent count growth in the U.S. and Canada combined was 2.3% with growth 
in almost every region.</p>
<p> Agent count outside of the U.S. and Canada increased by over 5,000 agents or almost 18% over 2016.</p>
<p> Strong gains in South America and parts of Europe have continued 
this year with significant contributions from Brazil, Portugal, Italy 
and Turkey.</p>
<p> It is terrific to see the accelerated growth of our international operations.</p>
<p> Outside the U.S. and Canada, we are in over 100 countries and 
territories. A number of the master franchise rights to these countries 
were sold in the last 15 years. Generally speaking, it takes these 
owners 5 to 10 years to build infrastructure and market share in their 
respective markets and we are seeing the healthy franchise sales and 
agent count growth numbers we expected. International growth is an 
opportunity for us in the longer term. We are first movers in many 
countries and are establishing our brand across the globe.</p>
<p> What's important for us now is establishing our footprint, expanding
 our brand name and helping those international owners successfully 
build their businesses. Slide 9 shows the breakdown of RE/MAX agents in 
the U.S. and Canada. The information on the left highlights U.S. agent 
growth of 2.3%, driven by gains in many states, including Florida, 
California and the Carolinas.</p>
<p> As expected, following a transition period after the acquisition in 
Q1 2016, New York is now growing again, adding over 10% to its agent 
count in 2017.</p>
<p> We believe New York represents an above average multiyear growth opportunity and one which we are very excited about.</p>
<p> As shown on the right, our Canadian agent count grew over 400 agents
 or 2.1%. Agent count growth in Canada was highlighted by strength in 
Québec, which grew more than 8% during 2017.</p>
<p> With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karri.</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN, CFO, RE/MAX HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks, Adam. Good 
morning, everyone. We issued our preliminary third quarter, fourth 
quarter and full year 2017 results yesterday afternoon. So hopefully, 
everyone has had a chance to review. Instead of discussing our 
financials line by line, I'd like to draw your attention to a few key 
topics. All of our standard quarterly results slides are included in the
 earnings presentation available on our website. I'm also happy to 
answer any additional earnings questions you might have during our 
Q&amp;A session. During Q3, we continued to execute on our core business
 drivers, increasing our global agent network, expanding Motto Mortgage 
and growing previously acquired independent regions, despite the 
financial headwinds resulting from the hurricanes last year. Turning to 
Slide 10, the third quarter 2017 hurricanes were extraordinary storms, 
which directly impacted thousands of our associates. We are inspired by 
how the entire RE/MAX network rallied to help those in need and their 
communities and we continue to support our impacted associates.</p>
<p> Given the magnitude of destruction from these historic storms, we 
waived certain fees for those who were directly affected. The fee 
waivers were for a limited time based on individual facts and 
circumstances. Total fees waived reduced Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA 
by approximately $1.7 million and reduced Q3 adjusted EPS by an 
estimated $0.03 per diluted share.</p>
<p> We continued these limited time fee waivers for a much smaller 
subset of impacted associates during the fourth quarter, resulting in a 
reduction of Q4 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300,000.</p>
<p> Turning to Slide 11. We announced in November, we acquired the 
master franchise rights for the Northern Illinois region, which includes
 Chicago, for $35.7 million. We funded the acquisition using cash on 
hand.</p>
<p> With this acquisition, we added almost 2,300 agents in more than 100 offices into the company-owned region.</p>
<p> It's important to note, we receive between 15% and 30% of fee 
revenue from independent regions. By acquiring a region, we capture the 
additional 70% to 85% of revenue generated by the region.</p>
<p> That is why these acquisitions are so attractive and so accretive to
 our business. Moreover, our team has done an excellent job 
transitioning regions, delivering the high quality service our network 
expects. The most recent acquisitions are performing at or above 
expectation.</p>
<p> Looking ahead, we expect the Northern Illinois acquisition to add 
approximately $5 million of revenue and $3.5 million to $4 million of 
adjusted EBITDA to FY 2018 results. Moving to Slide 12, we finished the 
year strong, delivering double-digit increases in both revenue and 
adjusted EPS in Q4. Revenue increased 11.4% to $49.5 million in the 
fourth quarter.</p>
<p> The acquisitions of independent regions increased revenue 7.5%, 
organic growth added 3.4% and favorable FX movements contributed just 
over 0.5% of growth.</p>
<p> The impact of hurricane related fee waivers and the timing of a 
large Canadian agent conference reduced organic growth by 1.5%. Q4 
organic growth would have otherwise been closer to 5%.</p>
<p> One other comment on revenue. New revenue recognition rules under 
U.S. GAAP became effective beginning in 2018. Generally, this new 
accounting standard impacts the timing of recognition of our franchise 
sales and franchise renewal revenue and is expected to modestly impact 
our financial results.</p>
<p> For example, we believe our 2017 revenue would have been lower by 
less than $2 million had the new accounting standard been in effect last
 year. In 2018, we estimate that our revenue will be negatively impacted
 by closer to $3 million upon adoption of the new accounting rules.</p>
<p> Looking at Slide 13, selling, operating and administrative expenses 
were $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $2.8 million or 11% 
over the prior year quarter. The increase in SO&amp;A was primarily due 
to $2.6 million in special investigation expenses, investment in Motto 
as well as an increase in other litigation cost, partially offset by 
expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the 
refinancing of the company's debt agreements.</p>
<p> Turning to Slide 14, the United States government enacted historic 
tax reform in late 2017, notably reducing the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p> The net impact to our Q4 and full year results was a net expense of 
$8.2 million or a reduction to GAAP earnings of $0.46 per diluted share.</p>
<p> I'd like to take a minute to review, generally, how the new tax law might impact RE/MAX holding.</p>
<p> From a business standpoint, it is difficult to predict the net impact of the tax reform on home buying and selling behavior.</p>
<p> Although, new restrictions on mortgage interest and property taxes 
deductions could limit activity for a subset of home buyers and sellers,
 we continue to be positive about housing in both the near- and 
long-term.</p>
<p> The U.S. market remains fairly healthy, with a strong underlying economy and still low interest rates.</p>
<p> Furthermore, long-term demographic trends appear to be favorable as 
millennials continue to grow into their prime home-buying years.</p>
<p> One of our most notable competitive advantages is our diverse 
geographic footprint of over 3700 RE/MAX offices spread out across the 
U.S. Although, we are not immune to individual market dynamics, we are 
somewhat insulated due to our distributed franchise model. Bottom line, 
our agents are among the most productive agents in the industry, 
out-selling, competing agents at large brokerages more than 2 to 1.</p>
<p> With our unique agent centric model, #1 global market share and the 
#1 name in real estate, we believe our agents will continue to help home
 buyers and sellers achieve their dreams.</p>
<p> As far as our effective tax rate is concerned, we expect it to drop 
in proportion to the overall corporate rate reduction. Previously, our 
GAAP effective tax rate was about 23% to 25%, lower than many companies 
due to our corporate and ownership structure. We now expect it to be 
approximately 14% to 17% beginning in FY 2018.</p>
<p> Furthermore, the reduced tax rate should enhance our ability to 
generate more free cash flow, perhaps our most attractive financial 
characteristic. In our scaled business model, a good portion of each 
incremental dollar of revenue translates into profit and cash flow.</p>
<p> Increased cash flow means more capital available for those 
initiatives, which are likely to deliver the best returns. Our capital 
allocation priorities remain unchanged.</p>
<p> We plan to continue to allocate capital to all 3 pillars of 
shareholder value creation. Reinvestment to drive future organic growth,
 acquiring independent regions and exploring other strategic 
acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders.</p>
<p> On Slide 15, I would like to share our outlook for the first quarter
 and the full year 2018. Before I do, a couple of items to bring to your
 attention.</p>
<p> First, recall that our margins are seasonal like our industry with 
Q1 and Q4 being lower than Q2 and Q3. Q1 margins are also impacted by 
expenses related to our annual agent conference being held in Las Vegas 
next week.</p>
<p> Severance costs are also expected to negatively impact Q1 this year 
by $1.9 million. Secondly, we continue to invest meaningfully in our 
business, providing our brokers and agents with the best training, tools
 and technology available. As a result, you should expect our margins to
 be modestly lower in 2018 than they were in the prior year.</p>
<p> The company's first quarter and full year 2018 outlook includes the 
expected impact from adopting the new revenue recognition accounting 
rule and assumes no further currency movements, acquisitions or 
divestitures.</p>
<p> For the first quarter of 2018, we expect agent count to increase 
5.5% to 6.5% over first quarter 2017, revenue in the range of $49.5 
million to $51 million and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 38% to
 39% of first quarter of 2018 revenue.</p>
<p> For the full year 2018, we expect agent count to increase 5% to 6% 
over full year 2017, revenue in a range of $205.5 million to $209 
million and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 50.5% to 52.5% of 
2018 revenue.</p>
<p> Also, we have included a supplementary slide in the appendix to our 
earnings presentation, which provides some further details on expected 
2018 amortization expense as a result of the Northern Illinois 
acquisition. Now, I'll turn it back to Adam.</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Thanks, Karri. Turning to Slide 16. In conclusion 
the fundamentals of our business remain solid, and I believe, our 
foundation has never been stronger. Our competitive advantages are 
multiple and significant. We have an outstanding business model and 
management team, supporting the world's best agents and brokers. We 
remain confident in our strategy and long-term business plan. And we are
 excited about driving our business forward.</p>
<p> With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.</p>
<p> Questions and Answers</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny from Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p> RYAN MCKEVENY, VP OF RESEARCH, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: Just a 
couple of quick ones. So on the domestic agent count growth, I just 
wanted to focus on that for a minute. We've seen deceleration there in 
the last few years, and it seems to have kind of picked up in terms of 
the decel in rate of growth in the back half of '17. So curious if you 
can just talk about the dynamics around the domestic agent comp growth, 
the recruiting environment, whether there is kind of macro factors at 
play or just the competitive dynamics of the brokerage industry. And 
then, ultimately within that guidance for 2018 of 5% to 6% total agent 
count growth, if you can give any thoughts around the magnitude of how 
the domestic agent count growth might fit into that guidance?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Good morning, Ryan and thanks for the kind words. 
Great to talk to you today. Yes, we -- obviously, that's one of the 
fundamentals of our business is agent growth. So we keep a close eye on 
it. And as you probably hear throughout the industry, competition for 
the agents is as fierce as ever, however, we continue to stay on top of 
and ramp up our value proposition that we are delivering to the field. 
You look at NAR agent growth, it was 5.5% year-over-year while we did 
2.3% in U.S., which is typical of our system. We typically lag NAR when 
it comes to agent growth because we are very selective in the position 
in the market that we pursue in the agents. We want high productive, 
professional, experienced agents and that's what we continue to go 
after. With the turnover rate in the industry right now and the fierce 
competition that you're talking about, I think what you're going to see 
is, you're going to see consistent numbers from what we've been seeing 
recently. So we just finished a 44-city speaking tour, the 
Profit/Ability tour where we met with a great deal of our broker owners 
throughout North America and the sentiment for gaining agents is strong.
 There was a lot of excitement amongst the brokers and a lot of dynamics
 in the market that they have to be excited about.</p>
<p> So I think we're confident that what we are -- what we've seen is 
what we're going to continue to see, and we continue to iterate on our 
business model to provide the highest quality product and service to our
 agents.</p>
<p> RYAN MCKEVENY: Thank you, that's helpful. And then one on the 2018 
EBITDA guidance. So the margin guidance of 50.5% to 52.5%, that's, as 
you mentioned, likely to be down from the 53% in 2017, down from '16. So
 I know you mentioned, just the ongoing investments and such, but I was 
wondering if you can give a bit more color because generally speaking, 
we view RE/MAX as having somewhat fixed cost structure for the most part
 so I think generally people expect some leverage in that model. So can 
you maybe call out the moving pieces there impacting that margin to 
potentially be lower in '18 versus '17?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Good morning, Ryan, it's Karri. No, it's a great 
question. One thing to keep in mind is that about 50% of our cost 
structure is in personnel. And as Adam mentioned in the scripted 
remarks, there are some initiatives that will drive personnel higher 
this year. We are really focused on innovation, technology and making 
sure that we enhance the overall value proposition and the new strategy 
function that's been established under Pete Crowe's leadership is going 
to result in some additional investment in personnel. And then we are 
also continuing to focus on technology and tools that we're offering to 
the network, really focused on automation and leveraging digital and 
social capabilities for our network, which will result in some 
additional investment as well as just some overall foundational 
technology investment. So we're really looking to leverage the other 
financial characteristics of the business -- free cash flow -- to put 
that back into the business.</p>
<p> But do expect to see a little bit of reinvestment to pull the 
margins down, just a little bit. But again, focused on long-term growth.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p> VIKRAM MALHOTRA, VP, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just wanted 
to clarify now that sort of the roles are separate. I know you can't 
give -- I'm not asking for more information on the specifics of the 
investigation. Just going forward, will Dave be involved in sort of -- 
say, negotiations for buying back regions or the day-to-day operations. 
Maybe give us a bit color what his role will be?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Good morning, Vikram, and thank you. Likewise, I 
look forward to seeing you in person one of these days. Dave has stepped
 back from day-to-day operations. The executive team that we have in 
place has been heavily involved in day-to-day operations for quite some 
time, as it is. And with respect to the continued future-looking 
discussions of acquisitions, things like that, the executive team has 
been a primary driver in those to begin with. Dave built those 
relationships over the years, however, we've continue those 
relationships quite well and have very good relationships with the 
different independent regional owners.</p>
<p> So the dynamics of that process, I don't believe will change. Dave 
will be handling some major events, some speaking engagements, things 
like that. But we're running the show here, myself and the executive 
team, and we're quite confident in the direction of the organization, as
 a result.</p>
<p> VIKRAM MALHOTRA: Okay. And then just on Motto. Seems like you've 
have had pretty good success. Can you maybe just -- are all the 70 
franchises, are they all with existing RE/MAX agents or owners? And 
then, can you maybe just talk about how you see this sort of trending 
over the next 12 months or so?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: I'm going to toss this over to the brand President of Motto, Ward Morrison. So Ward, do you want to take that?</p>
<p> WARD MORRISON: Yes, Vikram, great question. The majority are still 
within the RE/MAX family but we have opened it up, as we talked about, 
and are getting interest from a few other different customer types that 
we're excited about. So although that number still remains small 
compared to the RE/MAX's, we're excited to open up our customer base to 
varying types.</p>
<p> VIKRAM MALHOTRA: So just in that 70 there are a very modest number that are owned by non-RE/MAX?</p>
<p> WARD MORRISON: Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p> VIKRAM MALHOTRA: Got it. And just to clarify, lastly, it's still a 
fixed fee per office, right? That's the case for both RE/MAX run Motto 
and non-RE/MAX's.</p>
<p> WARD MORRISON: Yes, Vikram,, that is correct. It's a time-based 
fixed-fee model so as they move along our franchise agreement life 
cycle, increase over time and the reach the maximum amount and then stay
 at that level.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens Inc.</p>
<p> JOHN ROBERT CAMPBELL, VP AND RESEARCH ANALYST, STEPHENS INC., 
RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on the conclusion of the investigation. I 
know it's something you guys worked hard on. You guys have -- the $2 
million or so of franchisee waivers obviously, you'll get that uplift 
this year. And then, you've got the $5 million from the Northern 
Illinois buyout. And Karri, I think you said $3 million drag from the 
accounting changes. But if you guys do sell kind of the same level of 
Motto franchises that you expect to this year that probably offsets the 
$3 million. But if I back all of that out of guidance, I'm getting to 
kind of core business organic growth of about 2%. Does that -- so first,
 does that sound about right, is that math right? And then secondly, if 
you guys maybe can talk about to the assumptions of home sales trends 
this year, and what's that -- what's in guidance?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Sure. So John, just thinking through that a 
little bit. On an organic basis, we've said historically that we expect 
to be kind of in the mid-single-digits from an organic growth 
perspective. We think that the revenue recognition changes are going to 
adversely impact that by about 100 basis points. So we're going to be a 
little bit low than that -- lower than that but not as low as what your 
model is suggesting.</p>
<p> And then with respect to just overall kind of housing trends and how
 we see that? I mean we're still very -- we are still confident in terms
 of just overall housing trends. As Adam mentioned in his scripted 
remarks, we're still seeing strong demand with some constraints of buy. 
But overall, our distributed franchise model looking at 3,700 offices 
spread out across the U.S. we think mitigates some of that risk. And all
 of that has been really baked into what we have come out with from a 
top line guidance perspective.</p>
<p> JOHN ROBERT CAMPBELL: Okay, I guess just kind to kind of segue way 
off of that. So January was down a little bit, it looked like, 
year-over-year as far as units. Are you expecting unit growth within 
guidance for the full year?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes. So we are -- if you looked at 2017 versus 
2016 and just terms of transactions, we trended pretty consistent with 
our U.S. agent count growth in the U.S. And so that's -- we're expecting
 somewhat similar trends as we go into 2018.</p>
<p> JOHN ROBERT CAMPBELL: Okay, and then on the New York region. Can you
 just provide any kind of updates there. How many new franchises have 
you sold since you took over? And then maybe how much faster you're 
growing agents and kind of where we are as far as penetration? I know 
you guys kind of target that 5% or so of state agents?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Yes, good morning, it's Adam. We're, we're excited 
about New York. It seems to be going quite well. We've seen about 10% 
agent growth in 10 franchise sales there. The region has gained 
traction. And the expectation is about 10 per -- franchises per year in 
growth in that region. Keep in mind, it's a very good opportunity for 
us, but it's not a huge region, if you will. But we're seeing, what we 
think to be, quite a successful operation occurring there and that's 
what we expect to continue.</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes, just building on top of what Adam was 
talking about. I think the other thing that's important to note with New
 York as well as even other independent regions that we acquired in '16 
is that they are really performing really consistent to our expectation.
 And so we're really excited about kind of that above average organic 
growth that New York, we think, will bring over the long term. And 
everything is performing very much in line with what we thought.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.</p>
<p> JASON SCOTT DELEEUW, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY
 COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: On the guidance with the agent growth, 
it's implied to slow as the year goes on. Just any thoughts or details 
around that, just kind of in the recruitment strategy that you have. 
Just looking for a little bit more detail on that.</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: First of all, good morning, Jason, and thank you. I 
don't necessarily know that we're going to see slowing agent growth 
throughout the year. We are throughout the U.S. and as Karri said, in so
 many different markets that different markets have seasonalities and 
changes and things like that. But consistently across U.S., we don't 
anticipate slowing agent growth throughout the year. The key focus of 
our organization is expanding our franchise network and growing agents. 
And of course, reinvesting in the business to continue to provide value 
to those franchisees and agents. So we're going to continue to iterate 
on our value proposition, especially with the new strategy and product 
position that we've created with Executive Vice President, Pete Crowe. 
As well as, we -- since the last call, we rolled our brand refresh. So 
there is a great deal of excitement in the marketplace, brokers and 
agents have a lot to get excited about. And people want something fresh 
and new and that's what we're providing to them, even with our 45-year 
old iconic position in the marketplace. But we operate from a position 
of strength in this and we still feel, absolutely, that we are the best 
place for the producing agents to be.</p>
<p> JASON SCOTT DELEEUW: Got it. And then just -- a question we get a 
lot is, how important is the technology to agent recruitment? I mean, 
generally agents are focused on the economics, but technology is 
becoming a bigger part of the process. So how important is that in 
recruitment from -- and is there any like a distinction between the CRM 
technology and lead generation solutions?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: It's something we talk about and strategize on every
 day. We are highly invested in the productivity of our agents as well 
as the tools that help boost that productivity, and it's something we're
 very excited about. We look at auto -- look at technology as providing a
 few things. One is, it provides exposure to the agents and the brand 
and their brand in the marketplace. And another thing it does is, it 
automates a lot of that process now. So we've been involved quite 
heavily with a couple of different initiatives, one with BombBomb, with a
 product called, Social Prompt, that we rolled out exclusively to our 
network this past fall, which allows automated production and 
distribution throughout the social channels of different product for 
those agents that they can modify on the fly and get out the door from 
their phones.</p>
<p> We also have heavy involvement with AdWorks in increasing our 
agents' exposure, gathering that attention online digitally. So we know 
that those things help build our agent's business and provide greater 
exposure to the customer base. So we are super excited about that. We 
also constantly look at other initiatives and are excited about 
continuing to explore and rollout those initiatives throughout this 
year.</p>
<p> Keep in mind also, we do still have the #1 real estate website when 
it comes to franchisors. The franchise brands, we had over 90 million 
people go to our website this past year and we are super excited about 
that. So technology is a big piece. But fundamentally, the business is 
still the business. It's a people business, it's a complicated process 
to buy and sell a house. And that demands the attention of a highly 
skilled operator to help the home buyer or seller to accomplish that 
effectively. We still see multiple offers across-the-board in the 
markets throughout the -- really around the world -- but predominantly 
in the U.S. and Canada. And that really means that you have to have a 
good person behind you in that process. So fundamentals of the business 
haven't drastically changed but the technology helps them execute on 
those nets, that's the balance that we keep.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p> DAVID EMERSON RIDLEY-LANE, VP, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH 
DIVISION: Wanted to ask on Canada, so that market had new mortgage 
regulations, which went into effect -- started this year -- poised to be
 a further headwind in the market. I did note that your Canadian agent 
counts were down slightly on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. 
Have you risk-adjusted your 2018 guidance for the potential of an 
accelerated downturn in Canada?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Good morning, David, this is Karri. If you look 
at Canada, it continues to be a very strong point for the RE/MAX 
network. We do have about 70% of the equivalent of the National 
Association of Realtors up in Canada. And we've always consistently said
 that we think that agent count growth is going to be around flat to 
slightly up. And that's really what is baked into our guidance for next 
year. We continue to see actually pretty strong volume there. And we're 
watching that market closely. But continue to believe that because of 
the overall strength of the brand in Canada that the assumptions are 
reasonable.</p>
<p> DAVID EMERSON RIDLEY-LANE: And then on Motto franchises, can you 
give us the revenue contribution for 2017 if you have that. And then on 
Motto's profitability, should Motto get to breakeven in 2018 and maybe 
have a little profit as well?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes, thanks, good morning. So in terms of Motto 
from a financial perspective. It really operated in 2017, like we 
thought. So low single digits of millions of dollars on the revenue line
 and in that investment. We do expect that 2018 will also be a net 
investment for Motto. That's partially driven by some headwinds from the
 revenue recognition guidelines. But regardless, we continue to be 
really excited about Motto. Ward and his team have done a fantastic job 
getting to 70-plus sales now and continue to expect comparable sales 
growth in 2018.</p>
<p> DAVID EMERSON RIDLEY-LANE: And then just quick numbers question. The
 pro forma tax rate you're using for adjusted net income, that was 38%. 
What's -- what is the new adjusted tax rate?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes, it should be closer to about 25%.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And your next question comes from the line of Bradley Berning with Craig-Hallum Capital.</p>
<p> BRADLEY ALLEN BERNING, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, CRAIG-HALLUM CAPITAL
 GROUP LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: On the EBITDA margin, one follow-up 
question on that. It's look like in 1Q, there is a greater 
year-over-year comparison challenge there than the overall year number. 
So can you talk through what are the moving parts in 1Q that kind of 
differ for the year? Are there any additional hiring timing that happens
 to be in 1Q or are there any comp or professional fees regarding the 
investigation issues that get into 1Q. Can you just kind of walk through
 the moving parts of that first?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Sure, absolutely. So the biggest driver, 
actually, is a severance charge that we expect to record of about $1.9 
million. So if you strip that out, you should get back to relatively 
consistent margins in terms of what we've seen on a historical basis in 
Q1.</p>
<p> BRADLEY ALLEN BERNING: Yes, that makes more sense, understood. And 
then, on the M&amp;A side of the equation for the other regions, can you
 talk about appetite? Can you just help us understand kind of that the 
pipeline of activity over time, what is the interest level?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Good morning, Brad, it's Adam. That's something, 
obviously, that we're always interested in, the reacquisition of the 
independent regions. Currently there are 9 regions, about 28,000 agents 
that would be available in the marketplace. It is a very opportunistic 
or lumpy approach, I guess, if you will, that we look at, in that. We 
maintain our relationships with those regional owners quite regularly. 
We are, obviously, quite interested in their regional growth, because it
 is part of our system to begin with. In all reality, it's up to the 
timing on the whole thing. Are they ready? Is the time right for them to
 come to the table with us? But we're always available and talking to 
them. Do we have timing on any of that? No, we don't. It happens as it 
happens. We've had great success over the past several years with seeing
 them come to the table and being able to execute on those. So we'll 
continue to look for future involvement with them at the table when it 
comes to the M&amp;A discussions and we are always available to talk.</p>
<p> BRADLEY ALLEN BERNING: One quick follow-up on that is, do you see 
that those parties are more interested in generational transitions or do
 you think that they are more interested in the sales route over the 
longer term not necessarily asking for near-term perspective. So just 
kind of curious as to how do you think most of those regions feel about 
those kind of 2 dynamics?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: I think it's a combination. It just depends on the 
personality and the infrastructure that they've built around those 
things. It's some yes, some, no type response. Whether or not that 
affects their desire to come to the table to discuss with us is not to 
be seen at this point. Again, it's opportunistic. It's on their part as 
well as relational on our part. Not something you can really forecast.</p>
<p> BRADLEY ALLEN BERNING: Yes, understood. And then real quickly on 
Motto. Just -- help us think through the dynamics of the timing of the 
revenue ramp on these, without adding new growth, per se, what is the 
revenue ramp from '17 to '18 to '19, just on the existing stuff that 
you've already sold. Just to help us all think about the magnitude of 
the contribution, how that changes as these -- not asking you for a 
sales forecast on new sales, just thinking about how the revenue works 
on the existing franchises you've already sold?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes, so this is Karri. I think if you think about
 2017, we had low single-digit in terms of millions of revenue. As you 
look forward, 2018, kind of low-to mid-single-digit. And then in outlier
 years getting more into the mid-single digits in terms of the revenue 
contribution.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Bose George with KBW.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: This is Tommy on for Bose. Just wanted to get 
you guys take on how you guys were able to implement sort of the regular
 agent fee increases that you guys do on a regular basis, just given 
that housing markets are pretty tight now, even though you might expect 
sales to be up next year. Just if you're getting sort of any pushback 
from getting those through to agents?</p>
<p> ADAM M. CONTOS: Good morning, Tommy, it's Adam. It's something that 
we really take a hard look at before we implement. Obviously, we give 
quite a bit of a lead time when it comes to doing that. And frankly, any
 agent fee increases that we introduce to the marketplace are very 
nominal to begin with, we talked about $2.50 a month or something like 
that per agent. And that is just a portion of -- a very small portion --
 of what an agent's monthly expenses boiled down to be in operating 
their business. When you look at everything that goes out the door, 
$2.50 is less than a cup of coffee on a monthly basis. So in all 
reality, it's -- if you provide and continue to increase the customer 
experience which is the experience that we provide to the agents and 
brokers -- and increase the value -- I think that people are okay with 
nominal adjustments. If they can reinsert that into their business and 
see growth in their business as a result. And that's our goal, is 
anytime we do something like that, we want to make sure that we've 
provided far more value to our customer base in doing so.</p>
<p> Generally, we do -- some people say, okay, why are you doing this? 
In all reality, once we discuss it or if anybody even does question it, 
you know they realize, okay, you are providing me higher value and this 
is a very teeny, tiny function of my business expenses. So we're okay 
with it. We feel it helps us to run our business better and provide more
 value to them and that it drastically outweighs that nominal increase.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got it. And separately, it looks like a lot of
 the year-over-year growth that you guys have in agent count is coming 
from the international, outside of the U.S. and Canada. Could you just 
remind us if there is any sort of difference in the fee structure there 
or the kind of expected revenue that you guys get from those agents?</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Yes, no, it's a great question. So In terms of 
agent count outside of the U.S. and Canada, on a per agent basis, in 
terms of revenue, they really contribute about $200 per agent. That 
compares to in our own region in the U.S. and Canada about $2,500 per 
agent. So there is a difference in terms of revenue. But as Adam talked 
about earlier, the power of the brand and the global presence of the 
brand is really important and we believe with kind of just overall 
trends in globalization, expanding that global footprint is a key 
competitive advantage for the company and for the brand around the 
world.</p>
<p> UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got you. If kind of the trend continues where 
that almost mid-teen percentage year-over-year, then it could become a 
bigger part of the pie eventually.</p>
<p> KARRI R. CALLAHAN: Eventually. Yes, it's absolutely a long-term, 
strategic opportunity for us. And it's something that we look at on a 
regular basis.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.</p>
<p> ANDY SCHULZ: Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all for joining us on the
 call today. That concludes our prepared remarks. Have a great day.</p>
<p> OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.</p>
